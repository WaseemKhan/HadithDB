      <h1> <em> The Book on Salutations and Greetings (Kitab As-Salam) </em> </h1>
      <br>
      <p><strong> INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
      <p> Just as the face is the index to the mind, in the same way the words of greetings which are exchanged amongst people indicate the spiritual role of a society. The gestures, and the expressions of salutations are, therefore, the indicators of the ideals for which a particular society stands. The common practice with the pre-Islamic Arabs and thi modern West is to greet one another with Good Morning and Good Evening accompanied by a gesture of the hand or the nodding of head. These words have no spiritual and moral significance, but just a wish that one should find one's mornings and evenings happy. The words of greeting which Islam has exhorted its followers to use at the time of meeting are as-Salam-u-'Alaikum which have a deep spiritual and moral significance behind them Since the predominant feature of Islamic faith and practice is peace within and peace without, it has, therefore, been made a watchword which should be repeated on every occasion when two Muslims meet so that the utmost importance of peace should be constantly inculcated in the mind of every Muslim, and he should have full consciousness of the great reality that he lives in this world as a messenger of peace for mankind. peace amongst individuals and nations. -The second important feature of words of greeting in Islam is that they convey the message of peace not only to the person who is greeted but to the whole of the Muslim society as it is the plural pronoun that is used for the blessing of peace. (The pronoun'Alaikum has a evry wide range and all the Muslims come within its orbit.) </p>
      <p> The two words as-Salam-u-'Alaikum may be called the irreducible minimum which are essential for greeting one another. The Muslims have been commanded to add to this expression some other words with a view to excelling one another in showering blessing upon the Muslims. The words as-Salam-u-'Alaikum are generally suffixed with these words Rahmat Allah wa Barakaatuh (mercy of Allah and His bleasings). These three words:" peace..., mercy" and" blessings of Allah" in fact form the sum and substance of Islam and the Muslims are asked to shower upon one another these benedictions. so that they may be able to live in this world and the Hereafter in perfect peace and tranquillity and blessings and mercy of Allah around him. </p>
      <p> According to Imam Nawawl, greeting with the words of as-Salam-u-'Alaikum is a Sunnah, and responding to it is Wajib (obligatory), but this essentiality is of the nature of Kifaya, meaning thereby that if a few persons out of the whole assembly or group respond to the greeting it will absolve all of the responsibility of response but if no response comes forth from any quarter all are held responsible for it. </p>

We said: We were sitting here without (any intention of doing harm to the passers-by) ; we are sitting to discuss matters and to hold conversation amongst ourselves.

'Umar b Khattab used to say: Allah's Messenger, ask your ladies to observe veil, but Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not do that. So there went out Sauda, daughter of Zarn'a, the wife of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), during one of the nights when it was dark. She was a tall statured lady. 'Umar called her saying: Sauda, we recognise you. (He did this with the hope that the verses pertaining to veil would be revealed.)

He (Hadrat 'Umar) sought their advice, and they told him that the scourge had broker, out in Syria. There was a difference of opinion (whether they should proceed further or go back to their homes in such a situation). Some of them said: You ('Umar) have set forth for a task, and, therefore, we would not advise you to go back, whereas some of them said: You have along with you the remnants (of the sacred galaxy) of men and (the blessed) Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), so we would not advise you to go forth towards this calamity (with such eminent persons and thus expose them deliberately to a danger). He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: You can now go away. He said: Call to me the Ansar. So I called them to him, and he consulted them, and they trod the same path as was trodden by the Muhajirin, and they differed in their opinions as they had differed. He said: Now, you can go.

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What did you say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shot (of meteor)? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of anyone nor on the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He decides to do a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of this world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the heaven of the world. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages to overhear and he carries it to his friends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack them with meteors. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.</p>

We went with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) (to participate in the Battle) of Trench when a young man in the midday used to seek permission from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) to return to his family. One day he sought permission from him and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) (after granting him the permission) said to him: Carry your weapons with you for I fear the tribe of Quraiza (may harm you). The man carried the weapons and then came back and found his wife standing between the two doors. He bent towards her smitten by jealousy and made a dash towards her with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on the bedding. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having fixed it in the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died first, the snake or the young man. We came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and made a mention to him and said: Supplicate to Allah that that (man) may be brought back to life. Thereupon he said: Ask forgiveness for your companion and then said: There are in Medina jinns who have accepted Islam, so when you see any one of them, pronounce a warning to it for three days, and if they appear before you after that, then kill it for that is a devil.</p>

When we looked we found a big snake, the rest of the hadith is the same. And in this Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Verily in these houses there live aged (snakes), so when you see one of them, make life hard for it for three days, and if it goes away (well and good), otherwise kill it for (in that case) it would be a nonbeliever. And he (the Holy Prophet) said (to his Companions): Go and bury your companion (who had died by the snake bite).</p>
