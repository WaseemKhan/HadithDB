He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have not sent it to you that you wear it, but I have sent It to you so that you may derive benefit out of it; and Usama (donned) the garment (presented to him) and appeared to be brisk, whereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) looked at him with a look by which he perceived that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not like what he had done. He said: Allah's Messenger. why is it that you look at me like this. whereas you yourself presented it to me?

And there was in his hand (in the hand of Allah's Apostle) a staff. He threw it from his hand and said: Never has Allah or His messengers (angels) ever broken their promise.
