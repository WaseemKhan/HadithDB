Then Muhayyisa found 'Abdullah b. Sahl having been killed. He buried him, and then came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). They were Huwayyisa b. Mas'ud and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl, and he (the latter one) was the youngest of the people (those three who had come to seek an interview with the Holy Prophet) began to talk before his Companions (had spoken). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The eldest one (eldest in regard to age should speak). So he kept quiet, and his companions (Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa) began to speak, and he ('Abd al Rahman) spoke along with them and they narrated to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) the murder of 'Abdullah b. Sahl. Thereupon he said to them: Are you prepared to take fifty oaths so that you may be entitled (to blood-wit) of your companion (or your man who has murdered)? They said: How can we take an oath on a matter which we have not witnessed? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will exonerate themselves by fifty oaths. They said: How can we accept the oaths of people who are unbelievers? When Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw that, he himself paid his blood-wit.</p>

Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Show regard for the greatness of the old, or he said: Let the eldest begin speaking. Then they (Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa) spoke about the matter of their companion (murder of their cousin, 'Abdullah b. Sahl). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let fifty (persons) among you take oath for levelling the charge (of murder) against a person amongst them, and he would be surrendered to you. They said: We have not witnessed this matter ourselves. How can we then take oath? He (the Holy Prophet) said: The Jews will exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said: Messenger of Allah, they are non-believing people. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) paid the blood wit for him. Sahl said: As one day I entered the fold a she-camel amongst those camels hit me with its leg.</p>

Then Huwayyisa spoke and then Muhayyisa also spoke. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: They should either pay blood-wit for your companion, or be prepared for war.

        <p> Anas b. Malik reported that a Jew killed a girl with a stone for her silver ornaments. She was brought to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) when there was yet some life in her. He (the Holy Prophet) said to her: Has so and so killed you? She indicated with the nod of her head: No. He said for the second time, and she again said: No with the nod of her head. He asked for the third time, and she said: Yes with the nod of her head and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded to crush his head between two stones.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p> Miswar b. Makhrama reported that 'Umar b. Khattab consulted people about the diyat of abortion of an unboam child. Mughira b. Shu'ba said: I bear witness to the fact that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave judgment about it that a good quality of slave or female slave should be given for it. Thereupon 'Umar said: Bring one who may bear witness to you. Then Muhammad b. Maslama bore witness to him.</p>
