          twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to 
          come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, "Whoever was in Itikaf with

          the odd ones of them." It rained that night and the roof of the mosque
          dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my 
          own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet 
          (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).

          ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got
          up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they

          Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah's Apostle . He told 
          them: Do not run away! And said, "She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai."
          Both of them said, "Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O 
          Allah's Apostle!" And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), "Satan
          reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, 
          (everywhere in one's body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an 
          evil thought in your minds."

        <p> I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, "Did you hear Allah's Apostle talking 
          about the Night of Qadr?" He replied in the affirmative and said, 
          "Once we were in Itikaf with Allah's Apostle in the middle ten days of
          (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and 
          Allah's Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said,
          'I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but 
          had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten 
          nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and 
          water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had 
          been in Itikaf with Allah's Apostle should return for it.' The people 
          returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in 
          the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the 
          prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah's Apostle
          prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the 
          nose of the Prophet.

          Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. 
          When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and

          for I do not want to see them." So, the tents were removed. The 
          Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but
