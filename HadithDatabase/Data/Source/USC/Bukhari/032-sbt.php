        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> I heard Allah's Apostle saying regarding Ramadan, "Whoever prayed at 
          night in it (the month of Ramadan) out of sincere Faith and hoping for
          a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven."

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever prayed at night the whole month of 
          Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then 
          all his previous sins will be forgiven." Ibn Shihab (a sub-narrator) 
          said, "Allah's Apostle died and the people continued observing that 
          (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it 
          remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early 
          days of 'Umar's Caliphate." 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Abdul Qari said, "I 
          went out in the company of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab one night in Ramadan 
          to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups. A man 
          praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, 
          'Umar said, 'In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under
          the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in 
          congregation!)'. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind 
          Ubai bin Ka'b. Then on another night I went again in his company and 
          the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, 'Umar remarked,
          'What an excellent Bid'a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but 
          the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better 
          than the one they are offering.' He meant the prayer in the last part 
          of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of
          the night."

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated 'Urwa:
        <p> That he was informed by 'Aisha, "Allah's Apostle went out in the 
          middle of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed 
          behind him. In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large
          number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). 
          In the next morning the people again talked about it and on the third 
          night the mosque was full with a large number of people. Allah's 
          Apostle came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night
          the Mosque was overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them,
          but the Prophet came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the 
          morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the 
          people) said, "Amma ba'du, your presence was not hidden from me but I 
          was afraid lest the night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and
          you might not be able to carry it on." So, Allah's Apostle died and 
          the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). "

        <p> that he asked 'Aisha "How was the prayer of Allah's Apostle in 
          Ramadan?" She replied, "He did not pray more than eleven Rakat in 
          Ramadan or in any other month. He used to pray four Rakat ---- let 
          alone their beauty and length----and then he would pray four ----let 
          alone their beauty and length ----and then he would pray three Rakat 
          (Witr)." She added, "I asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! Do you sleep before 
          praying the Witr?' He replied, 'O 'Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart 
          does not sleep."

          Allah's Apostle said, "It seems that all your dreams agree that (the 
          Night of Qadr) is in the last seven nights, and whoever wants to

        <p> Narrated Abu Salama:
        <p> I asked Abu Sa'id, and he was a friend of mine,  (about the Night of 
          Qadr) and he said, "We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in 
          the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the 
          morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and 
          said, 'I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was 
          caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last 
          ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself 
          prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l'tikaf 
          with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day's period)', 
          and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky 
          but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started 
          leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm 
          leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Allah's Apostle
          prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his 
          forehead."

        <p> Allah's Apostle used to practice Itikaf (in the mosque) in the middle 
          third of Ramadan and after passing the twenty nights he used to go 
          back to his house on the 21st, and the people who were in Itikaf with 
          him also used to go back to their houses. Once in Ramadan, in which he
          practiced Itikaf, he established the night prayers at the night in 
          which he used to return home, and then he addressed the people and 
          ordered them whatever Allah wished him to order and said, "I used to 
          practice Itikaf for these ten days (i.e. the middle 113rd but now I 
          intend to stay in Itikaf for the last ten days (of the month); so 
          whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion. I
          have verily been shown (the date of) this Night (of Qadr) but I have 
          forgotten it. So search for it in the odd nights of the last ten days 
          (of this month). I also saw myself (in the dream) prostrating in mud 
          and water." On the night of the 21st, the sky was covered with clouds 
          and it rained, and the rain-water started leaking through the roof of 
          the mosque at the praying place of the Prophet . I saw with my own 
          eyes the Prophet at the completion of the morning prayer leaving with 
          his face covered with mud and water.
