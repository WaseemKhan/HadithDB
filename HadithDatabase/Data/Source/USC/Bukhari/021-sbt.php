          <p> Narrated Ibn Abbas:
          <p> When the Prophet got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used
            to say: Allahumma lakal-hamd. Anta qaiyimus-samawati wal-ard wa man 
            fihinna. Walakal-hamd, Laka mulkus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. 
            Walakal-hamd, anta nurus-samawati wal-ard. Walakalhamd, anta-l-haq wa 
            wa'duka-l-haq, wa liqa'uka Haq, wa qualuka Haq, wal-jannatu Han 
            wan-naru Haq wannabiyuna Haq. Wa Muhammadun, sallal-lahu'alaihi 
            wasallam, Haq, was-sa'atu Haq. Allahumma aslamtu Laka wabika amantu, 
            wa 'Alaika tawakkaltu, wa ilaika anabtu wa bika khasamtu, wa ilaika 
            hakamtu faghfir li ma qaddamtu wama akh-khartu wama as-rartu wama'a 
            lantu, anta-l-muqaddim wa anta-l-mu akh-khir, la ilaha illa anta (or 
            la ilaha ghairuka). (O Allah! All the praises are for you, You are the
            Holder of the Heavens and the Earth, And whatever is in them. All the 
            praises are for You; You have the possession of the Heavens and the 
            Earth And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You are 
            the Light of the Heavens and the Earth And all the praises are for 
            You; You are the King of the Heavens and the Earth; And all the 
            praises are for You; You are the Truth and Your Promise is the truth, 
            And to meet You is true, Your Word is the truth And Paradise is true 
            And Hell is true And all the Prophets (Peace be upon them) are true; 
            And Muhammad is true, And the Day of Resurrection is true. O Allah ! I
            surrender (my will) to You; I believe in You and depend on You. And 
            repent to You, And with Your help I argue (with my opponents, the 
            non-believers) And I take You as a judge (to judge between us). Please
            forgive me my previous And future sins; And whatever I concealed or 
            revealed And You are the One who make (some people) forward And (some)
            backward. There is none to be worshipped but you . Sufyan said that 
            'Abdul Karim Abu Umaiya added to the above, 'Wala haula Wala quwata 
            illa billah' (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).

          <p> Narrated Salim's father:
          <p> In the life-time of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it
            to Allah's Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to 
            Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in 
            the Mosque in the life-time of the Prophet.  I saw in the dream that 
            two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built 
            all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in 
            it were known to me. I started saying, "I seek refuge with Allah from 
            the Fire." Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I 
            narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah's Apostle. The 
            Prophet said, "Abdullah is a good man. I wish he prayed Tahajjud." 
            After that 'Abdullah (i.e. Salim's father) used to sleep but a little 
            at night.

            used to prolong the prostration to such an extent that one could 
            recite fifty verses (of the Quran) before he would lift his head. He 
            used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the Fajr prayer and then used to
            lie down on his right side till the call-maker came and informed him 
            about the prayer.

            been sent down (disclosed). Go and wake the sleeping lady occupants of

          <p> One night Allah's Apostle came to me and Fatima, the daughter of the 
            Prophet and asked, "Won't you pray (at night)?" I said, "O Allah's 
            Apostle! Our souls are in the hands of Allah and if He wants us to get
            up He will make us get up." When I said that, he left us without 
            saying anything and I heard that he was hitting his thigh and saying,

            it, for fear that people might act on it and it might be made 
            compulsory for them. The Prophet never prayed the Duha prayer, but I

            many people gathered. On the third and the fourth nights more people 
            gathered, but Allah's Apostle did not come out to them. In the morning
            he said, "I saw what you were doing and nothing but the fear that it 
            (i.e. the prayer) might be enjoined on you, stopped me from coming to

          <p> that he remembered Allah's Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful 
            of water which he had thrown on his face, after taking it from a well 
            that was in their house. Mahmud said that he had heard Itban bin 
            Malik, who was present with Allah's Apostle in the battle of Badr 
            saying, "I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and 
            there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained it 
            used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I 
            went to Allah's Apostle and said, 'I have weak eye-sight and the 
            valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it 
            becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my 
            house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying
            place.' Allah's Apostle said, 'I will do so.' So Allah's Apostle and 
            Abu Bakr came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had 
            risen high. Allah's Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I 
            admitted him. He did not sit before saying, 'Where do you want us to 
            offer the prayer in your house?' I pointed to the place where I wanted
            him to pray. So Allah's Apostle stood up for the prayer and started 
            the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he 
            offered two Rakat, and finished them with Taslim, and we also 
            performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called "Khazir" 
            which I had prepared for him.--("Khazir" is a special type of dish 
            prepared from barley flour and meat soup)--
          <p> When the neighbors got the news that Allah's Apostle was in my house, 
            they poured it till there were a great number of men in the house. One
            of them said, 'What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?' One of
            them replied, 'He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His 
            Apostle.' On that Allah's Apostle said, 'Don't say this. Haven't you 
            seen that he said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah for 
            Allah's sake only.' The man replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know 
            better; but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with 
            the hypocrites.' Allah's Apostle replied, 'No doubt, whoever says. 
            None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and by that he wants 
            the pleasures of Allah, then Allah will save him from Hell." Mahmud 
            added, "I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was 
            Ab-u Aiyub, the companion of Allah's Apostle in the battle in which he
            (Ab-u Aiyub) died and Yazid bin Mu'aw7ya was their leader in Roman 
            Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, 'I doubt that 
            Allah's Apostle ever said what you have said.' I felt that too much, 
            and I vowed to Allah that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I 
            would (go to Medina and) ask Itban bin Malik if  he was still living 
            in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for 
            Hajj or 'Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to
            Bani Salim and Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was 
            leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I 
            greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that
            narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had 
            narrated it the first time."
