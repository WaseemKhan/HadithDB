          sent Abu 'Ubaida bin AlJarrah to Bahrain to collect the Jizya tax.

          Bahrain and appointed Al 'Ala bin Al-Hadrami as their chief; Abu 
          Ubaida arrived from Bahrain with the money. The Ansar heard of Abu 
          'Ubaida's arrival which coincided with the Fajr (morning) prayer led 
          by Allah's Apostle. When the Prophet finished the prayer, they came to
          him. Allah's Apostle smiled when he saw them and said, "I think you 
          have heard of the arrival of Abu 'Ubaida and that he has brought 
          something." They replied, "Yes, O Allah's Apostle! " He said, "Have 
          the good news, and hope for what will please you. By Allah, I am not 
          afraid that you will become poor, but I am afraid that worldly wealth 
          will be given to you in abundance as it was given to those (nations) 
          before you, and you will start competing each other for it as the 
          previous nations competed for it, and then it will divert you (from

        <p> Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri:
        <p> Allah's Apostle said, "The thing I am afraid of most for your sake, is
          the worldly blessings which Allah will bring forth to you." It was 
          said, "What are the blessings of this world?" The Prophet said, "The 
          pleasures of the world." A man said, "Can the good bring forth evil?" 
          The Prophet kept quiet for a while till we thought that he was being 
          inspired divinely. Then he started removing the sweat from his 
          forehead and said," Where is the questioner?" That man said, "I (am 
          present)." Abu Sa'id added: We thanked the man when the result (of his
          question) was such. The Prophet said, "Good never brings forth but 
          good. This wealth (of the world) is (like) green and sweet (fruit), 
          and all the vegetation which grows on the bank of a stream either 
          kills or nearly kills the animal that eats too much of it, except the 
          animal that eats the Khadira (a kind of vegetation). Such an animal 
          eats till its stomach is full and then it faces the sun and starts 
          ruminating and then it passes out dung and urine and goes to eat 
          again. This worldly wealth is (like) sweet (fruit), and if a person 
          earns it (the wealth) in a legal way and spends it properly, then it 
          is an excellent helper, and whoever earns it in an illegal way, he 
          will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied."

        <p> By Allah except Whom none has the right to- be worshipped, (sometimes)
          I used to lay (sleep) on the ground on my liver (abdomen) because of 
          hunger, and (sometimes) I used to bind a stone over my belly because 
          of hunger. One day I sat by the way from where they (the Prophet and h
          is companions) used to come out. When Abu Bakr passed by, I asked him 
          about a Verse from Allah's Book and I asked him only that he might 
          satisfy my hunger, but he passed by and did not do so. Then Umar 
          passed by me and I asked him about a Verse from Allah's Book, and I 
          asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by 
          without doing so. Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet ) passed by me and 
          he smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my 
          face. He said, "O Aba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!" I replied, "Labbaik, O 
          Allah's Apostle!" He said to me, "Follow me." He left and I followed 
          him. 
        <p> Then he entered the house and I asked permission to enter and was 
          admitted. He found milk in a bowl and said, "From where is this milk?"
          They said, "It has been presented to you by such-and-such man (or by 
          such and such woman)." He said, "O Aba Hirr!" I said, "Labbaik, O 
          Allah's Apostle!" He said, "Go and call the people of Suffa to me." 
          These people of Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no families, 
          nor money, nor anybody to depend upon, and whenever an object of 
          charity was brought to the Prophet , he would send it to them and 
          would not take anything from it, and whenever any present was given to
          him, he used to send some for them and take some of it for himself. 
          The order off the Prophet upset me, and I said to myself, "How will 
          this little milk be enough for the people of As-Suffa?"  thought I was
          more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself, 
          but behold! The Prophet came to order me to give that milk to them. I 
          wondered what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not
          but obey Allah and His Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and
          called them, and they came and asked the Prophet's permission to 
          enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house. 
        <p> The Prophet said, "O Aba-Hirr!" I said, "Labbaik, O Allah's Apostle!" 
          He said, "Take it and give it to them." So I took the bowl (of Milk) 
          and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and return 
          it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, 
          would drink his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to
          another man who would drink his fill and return it to me. Finally, 
          after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet who 
          took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and 
          said. "O Aba Hirr!" I replied, "Labbaik, O Allah's Apostle!" He said, 
          "There remain you and I." I said, "You have said the truth, O Allah's 
          Apostle!" He said, "Sit down and drink." I sat down and drank. He 
          said, "Drink," and I drank. He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink,
          till I said, "No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no 
          space for it (in my stomach)." He said, "Hand it over to me." When I 
          gave him the bowl, he praised Allah and pronounced Allah's Name on it 
          and drank the remaining milk.

        <p> Narrated Hudhaifa:
        <p> Allah's Apostle narrated to us two narrations, one of which I have 
          seen (happening) and I am waiting for the other. He narrated that 
          honesty was preserved in the roots of the hearts of men (in the 
          beginning) and then they learnt it (honesty) from the Qur'an, and then
          they learnt it from the (Prophet's) Sunna (tradition). He also told us
          about its disappearance, saying, "A man will go to sleep whereupon 
          honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will 
          remain, resembling the traces of fire. He then will sleep whereupon 
          the remainder of the honesty will also be taken away (from his heart) 
          and its trace will resemble a blister which is raised over the surface
          of skin, when an ember touches one's foot; and in fact, this blister 
          does not contain anything. So there will come a day when people will 
          deal in business with each other but there will hardly be any 
          trustworthy persons among them. Then it will be said that in 
          such-and-such a tribe there is such-and-such person who is honest, and
          a man will be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength,
          though indeed he will not have belief equal to a mustard seed in his 
          heart." The narrator added: There came upon me a time when I did not 
          mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion 
          would prevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim
          ruler would prevent him from cheating; but today I cannot deal except 
          with so-and-so and so-and-so. (See Hadith No. 208, Vol. 9)

          face. The Jew went to Allah's Apostle and informed him of what had 
          happened between him and the Muslim. Allah's Apostle said, "Don't give
          me superiority over Moses, for the people will fall unconscious on the
          Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain consciousness, and
          behold ! Moses will be there holding the side of Allah's Throne. I 
          will not know whether Moses has been among those people who have 
          become unconscious and then has regained consciousness before me, or 
          has been among those exempted by Allah from falling unconscious."

        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> Some people said, "O Allah's Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day
          of Resurrection?" He said, "Do you crowd and squeeze each other on 
          looking at the sun when it is not hidden by clouds?" They replied, 
          "No, Allah's Apostle." He said, "Do you crowd and squeeze each other 
          on looking at the moon when it is full and not hidden by clouds?" They
          replied, No, O Allah's Apostle!" He said, "So you will see Him (your 
          Lord) on the Day of Resurrection similarly Allah will gather all the 
          people and say, 'Whoever used to worship anything should follow that 
          thing. 'So, he who used to worship the sun, will follow it, and he who
          used to worship the moon will follow it, and he who used to worship 
          false deities will follow them; and then only this nation (i.e., 
          Muslims) will remain, including their hypocrites. Allah will come to 
          them in a shape other than they know and will say, 'I am your Lord.' 
          They will say, 'We seek refuge with Allah from you. This is our place;
          (we will not follow you) till our Lord comes to us, and when our Lord 
          comes to us, we will recognize Him. 
        <p> Then Allah will come to then in a shape they know and will say, "I am 
          your Lord.' They will say, '(No doubt) You are our Lord,' and they 
          will follow Him. Then a bridge will be laid over the (Hell) Fire." 
          Allah's Apostle added, "I will be the first to cross it. And the 
          invocation of the Apostles on that Day, will be 'Allahukka Sallim, 
          Sallim (O Allah, save us, save us!),' and over that bridge there will 
          be hooks Similar to the thorns of As Sa'dan (a thorny tree). Didn't 
          you see the thorns of As-Sa'dan?" The companions said, "Yes, O Allah's
          Apostle." He added, "So the hooks over that bridge will be like the 
          thorns of As-Sa-dan except that their greatness in size is only known 
          to Allah. These hooks will snatch the people according to their deeds.
          Some people will be ruined because of their evil deeds, and some will 
          be cut into pieces and fall down in Hell, but will be saved 
          afterwards, when Allah has finished the judgments among His slaves, 
          and intends to take out of the Fire whoever He wishes to take out from
          among those who used to testify that none had the right to be 
          worshipped but Allah. 
        <p> We will order the angels to take them out and the angels will know 
          them by the mark of the traces of prostration (on their foreheads) for
          Allah banned the f ire to consume the traces of prostration on the 
          body of Adam's son. So they will take them out, and by then they would
          have burnt (as coal), and then water, called Maul Hayat (water of 
          life) will be poured on them, and they will spring out like a seed 
          springs out on the bank of a rainwater stream, and there will remain 
          one man who will be facing the (Hell) Fire and will say, 'O Lord! It's
          (Hell's) vapor has Poisoned and smoked me and its flame has burnt me; 
          please turn my face away from the Fire.' He will keep on invoking 
          Allah till Allah says, 'Perhaps, if I give you what you want), you 
          will ask for another thing?' The man will say, 'No, by Your Power, I 
          will not ask You for anything else.' 
        <p> Then Allah will turn his face away from the Fire. The man will say 
          after that, 'O Lord, bring me near the gate of Paradise.' Allah will 
          say (to him), 'Didn't you promise not to ask for anything else? Woe to
          you, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are!' The man will keep on 
          invoking Allah till Allah will say, 'But if I give you that, you may 
          ask me for something else.' The man will say, 'No, by Your Power. I 
          will not ask for anything else.' He will give Allah his covenant and 
          promise not to ask for anything else after that. So Allah will bring 
          him near to the gate of Paradise, and when he sees what is in it, he 
          will remain silent as long as Allah will, and then he will say, 'O 
          Lord! Let me enter Paradise.' Allah will say, 'Didn't you promise that
          you would not ask Me for anything other than that? Woe to you, O son 
          of Adam ! How treacherous you are!' On that, the man will say, 'O 
          Lord! Do not make me the most wretched of Your creation,' and will 
          keep on invoking Allah till Allah will smile and when Allah will smile
          because of him, then He will allow him to enter Paradise, and when he 
          will enter Paradise, he will be addressed, 'Wish from so-and-so.' He 
          will wish till all his wishes will be fulfilled, then Allah will say, 
          All this (i.e. what you have wished for) and as much again therewith 
          are for you.' "
        <p> Abu Huraira added: That man will be the last of the people of Paradise
          to enter (Paradise).
        <p> Narrated 'Ata (while Abu Huraira was narrating): Abu Said was sitting 
          in the company of Abu Huraira and he did not deny anything of his 
          narration till he reached his saying: "All this and as much again 
          therewith are for you." Then Abu Sa'id said, "I heard Allah's Apostle 
          saying, 'This is for you and ten times as much.' " Abu Huraira said, 
          "In my memory it is 'as much again therewith.' "
