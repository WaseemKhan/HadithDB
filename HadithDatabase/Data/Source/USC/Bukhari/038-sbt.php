        <p> I got an agreement written between me and Umaiya bin Khalaf that 
          Umaiya would look after my property (or family) in Mecca and I would 
          look after his in Medina. When I mentioned the word 'Ar-Rahman' in the
          documents, Umaiya said, "I do not know 'Ar-Rahman.' Write down to me 
          your name, (with which you called yourself) in the Pre-lslamic Period 
          of Ignorance." So, I wrote my name ' 'Abdu 'Amr'. On the day (of the 
          battle) of Badr, when all the people went to sleep, I went up the hill
          to protect him. Bilal(1) saw him (i.e. Umaiya) and went to a gathering
          of Ansar and said, "(Here is) Umaiya bin Khalaf! Woe to me if he 
          escapes!" So, a group of Ansar went out with Bilal to follow us 
          ('Abdur-Rahman and Umaiya). Being afraid that they would catch us, I 
          left Umaiya's son for them to keep them busy but the Ansar killed the 
          son and insisted on following us. Umaiya was a fat man, and when they 
          approached us, I told him to kneel down, and he knelt, and I laid 
          myself on him to protect him, but the Ansar killed him by passing 
          their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my foot with his 
          sword. (The sub narrator said, " 'Abdur-Rahman used to show us the 
          trace of the wound on the back of his foot.")

        <p> Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira:
        <p> Allah's Apostle employed someone as a governor at Khaibar. When the 
          man came to Medina, he brought with him dates called Janib. The 
          Prophet asked him, "Are all the dates of Khaibar of this kind?" The 
          man replied, "(No), we exchange two Sa's of bad dates for one Sa of 
          this kind of dates (i.e. Janib), or exchange three Sa's for two." On 
          that, the Prophet said, "Don't do so, as it is a kind of usury (Riba) 
          but sell the dates of inferior quality for money, and then buy Janib 
          with the money". The Prophet said the same thing about dates sold by 
          weight. (See Hadith No. 506).

        <p> We had some sheep which used to graze at Sala'. One of our slavegirls 
          saw a sheep dying and she broke a stone and slaughtered the sheep with
          it. My father said to the people, "Don't eat it till I ask the Prophet
          about it (or till I send somebody to ask the Prophet)." So, he asked 
          or sent somebody to ask the Prophet, and the Prophet permitted him to 
          eat it. 'Ubaidullah (a sub-narrator) said, "I admire that girl, for 
          though she was a slave-girl, she dared to slaughter the sheep . "

          due)." When the people searched for a camel of that age, they found 
          none, but found a camel one year older. The Prophet said, "Give (it 
          to) him." On that, the man remarked, "You have given me my right in 
          full. May Allah give you in full." The Prophet said, "The best amongst

          said (to them), "Leave him, for the creditor (i.e. owner of a right) 
          has the right to speak." Allah's Apostle then said, "Give him a camel

        <p> When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing Islam, came
          to Allah's Apostle, he got up. They appealed to him to return their 
          properties and their captives. Allah's Apostle said to them, "The most
          beloved statement to me is the true one. So, you have the option of 
          restoring your properties or your captives, for I have delayed 
          distributing them." The narrator added, Allah's Apostle c had been 
          waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When 
          they realized that Allah's Apostle would return to them only one of 
          two things, they said, "We choose our captives." So, Allah's Apostle 
          got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised Allah as He deserved, 
          and said, "Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you with 
          repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, 
          whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, 
          and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from 
          the very first booty which Allah will give us then he can do so." The 
          people replied, "We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor 
          for Allah's Apostle." Then Allah's Apostle said, "We don't know who 
          amongst you has agreed and who hasn't. Go back and your chiefs may 
          tell us your opinion." So, all of them returned and their chiefs 
          discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their chiefs) came 
          to Allah's Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given 
          up their shares gladly and willingly.

        <p> I was accompanying the Prophet on a journey and was riding a slow 
          camel that was lagging behind the others. The Prophet passed by me and
          asked, "Who is this?" I replied, "Jabir bin 'Abdullah." He asked, 
          "What is the matter, (why are you late)?" I replied, "I am riding a 
          slow camel." He asked, "Do you have a stick?" I replied in the 
          affirmative. He said, "Give it to me." When I gave it to him, he beat 
          the camel and rebuked it. Then that camel surpassed the others 
          thenceforth. The Prophet said, "Sell it to me." I replied, "It is (a 
          gift) for you, O Allah's Apostle." He said, "Sell it to me. I have 
          bought it for four Dinars (gold pieces) and you can keep on riding it 
          till Medina." When we approached Medina, I started going (towards my 
          house). The Prophet said, "Where are you going?" I Sad, "I have 
          married a widow." He said, "Why have you not married a virgin to 
          fondle with each other?" I said, "My father died and left daughters, 
          so I decided to marry a widow (an experienced woman) (to look after 
          them)." He said, "Well done." When we reached Medina, Allah's Apostle 
          said, "O Bilal, pay him (the price of the camel) and give him extra 
          money." Bilal gave me four Dinars and one Qirat extra. (A sub-narrator
          said): Jabir added, "The extra Qirat of Allah's Apostle never parted 
          from me." The Qirat was always in Jabir bin 'Abdullah's purse.

        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> Allah's Apostle deputed me to keep Sadaqat (al-Fitr) of Ramadan. A 
          comer came and started taking handfuls of the foodstuff (of the 
          Sadaqa) (stealthily). I took hold of him and said, "By Allah, I will 
          take you to Allah's Apostle ." He said, "I am needy and have many 
          dependents, and I am in great need." I released him, and in the 
          morning Allah's Apostle asked me, "What did your prisoner do 
          yesterday?" I said, "O Allah's Apostle! The person complained of being
          needy and of having many dependents, so, I pitied him and let him go."
          Allah's Apostle said, "Indeed, he told you a lie and he will be coming
          again." I believed that he would show up again as Allah's Apostle had 
          told me that he would return. So, I waited for him watchfully. When he
          (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of foodstuff, I caught hold 
          of him again and said, "I will definitely take you to Allah's Apostle.
          He said, "Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I 
          promise I will not come back again." I pitied him and let him go. 
        <p> In the morning Allah's Apostle asked me, "What did your prisoner do." 
          I replied, "O Allah's Apostle! He complained of his great need and of 
          too many dependents, so I took pity on him and set him free." Allah's 
          Apostle said, "Verily, he told you a lie and he will return." I waited
          for him attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started
          stealing handfuls of the foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, "I 
          will surely take you to Allah's Apostle as it is the third time you 
          promise not to return, yet you break your promise and come." He said, 
          "(Forgive me and) I will teach you some words with which Allah will 
          benefit you." I asked, "What are they?" He replied, "Whenever you go 
          to bed, recite "Ayat-al-Kursi"-- 'Allahu la ilaha illa huwa-l-Haiy-ul 
          Qaiyum' till you finish the whole verse. (If you do so), Allah will 
          appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no satan will come 
          near you till morning. " So, I released him. In the morning, Allah's 
          Apostle asked, "What did your prisoner do yesterday?" I replied, "He 
          claimed that he would teach me some words by which Allah will benefit 
          me, so I let him go." Allah's Apostle asked, "What are they?" I 
          replied, "He said to me, 'Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-al-Kursi
          from the beginning to the end ---- Allahu la ilaha illa 
          huwa-lHaiy-ul-Qaiyum----.' He further said to me, '(If you do so), 
          Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you, and no 
          satan will come near you till morning.' (Abu Huraira or another 
          sub-narrator) added that they (the companions) were very keen to do 
          good deeds. The Prophet said, "He really spoke the truth, although he 
          is an absolute liar. Do you know whom you were talking to, these three
          nights, O Abu Huraira?" Abu Huraira said, "No." He said, "It was

        <p> Once Bilal brought Barni (i.e. a kind of dates) to the Prophet and the
          Prophet asked him, "From where have you brought these?" Bilal replied,
          "I had some inferior type of dates and exchanged two Sas of it for one
          Sa of Barni dates in order to give it to the Prophet; to eat." 
          Thereupon the Prophet said, "Beware! Beware! This is definitely Riba 
          (usury)! This is definitely Riba (Usury)! Don't do so, but if you want
          to buy (a superior kind of dates) sell the inferior dates for money 
          and then buy the superior kind of dates with that money."

          Waqf) to eat or provide his friends from it, provided the trustee had 
          no intention of collecting fortune (for himself). Ibn 'Umar was the

        <p> Narrated Anas bin Malik:
        <p> Abu Talha was the richest man in Medina amongst the Ansar and Beeruha'
          (garden) was the most beloved of his property, and it was situated 
          opposite the mosque (of the Prophet.). Allah's Apostle used to enter 
          it and drink from its sweet water. When the following Divine Verse 
          were revealed: 'you will not attain righteousness till you spend in 
          charity of the things you love' (3.93), Abu Talha got up in front of 
          Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Allah  says in His Book,
          'You will not attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) that 
          which you love,' and verily, the most beloved to me of my property is 
          Beeruha (garden), so I give it in charity and hope for its reward from
          Allah. O Allah's Apostle! Spend it wherever you like." Allah's Apostle
          appreciated that and said, "That is perishable wealth, that is 
          perishable wealth. I have heard what you have said; I suggest you to 
          distribute it among your relatives."  Abu Talha said, "I will do so, O
          Allah's Apostle." So, Abu Talha distributed it among his relatives and
          cousins. The sub-narrator (Malik) said: The Prophet said: "That is a 
          profitable wealth," instead of "perishable wealth".
