          held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for 
          it, then you will be helped in it (by Allah): and whenever you take an
          oath to do something and later you find that something else is better 
          than the first, then do the better one and make expiation for your 
          oath."

        <p> Narrated Abu Musa:
        <p> I went to the Prophet along with a group of Al-Ash'ariyin in order to 
          request him to provide us with mounts. He said, "By Allah, I will not 
          provide you with mounts and I haven't got anything to mount you on." 
          Then we stayed there as long as Allah wished us to stay, and then 
          three very nice looking she-camels were brought to him and he made us 
          ride them. When we left, we, or some of us, said, "By Allah, we will 
          not be blessed, as we came to the Prophet asking him for mounts, and 
          he swore that he would not give us any mounts but then he did give us.
          So let us go back to the Prophet and remind him (of his oath)." When 
          we returned to him (and reminded him of the fact), he said, "I did not
          give you mounts, but it is Allah Who gave you. By Allah, Allah 
          willing, if I ever take an oath to do something and then I find 
          something else than the first, I will make expiation for my oath and 
          do the thing which is better (or do something which is better and give
          the expiation for my oath)."

          Allah, if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may 
          harm his family, he commits a greater sin in Allah's sight than that 
          of dissolving his oath and making expiation for it."

          So Allah's Apostle got up saying, "If you people are criticizing 
          Usama's leadership, you have already criticized the leadership of his 
          father before. But Wa-aimullah (i.e., By Allah), he (i.e. Zaid) 
          deserved the leadership, and he was one of the most beloved persons to

          The other who was wiser, said, "Yes, O Allah's Apostle! Judge between 
          us according to Allah's Laws and allow me to speak. The Prophet said, 
          "Speak." He said, "My son was a laborer serving this (person) and he 
          committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, The people said 
          that my son is to be stoned to death, but I ransomed him with 
          one-hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the learned people, 
          who informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and will
          be exiled for one year, and stoning will be the lot for the man's 
          wife." Allah's Apostle said, "Indeed, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is,
          I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws: As for your sheep 
          and slave girl, they are to be returned to you." Then he scourged his 
          son one hundred lashes and exiled him for one year. Then Unais 
          Al-Aslami was ordered to go to the wife of the second man, and if she 
          confessed (the crime), then stone her to death. She did confess, so he
          stoned her to death.

        <p> Allah's Apostle employed an employee (to collect Zakat). The employee 
          returned after completing his job and said, "O Allah's Apostle! This 
          (amount of Zakat) is for you, and this (other amount) was given to me 
          as a present." The Prophet said to him, "Why didn't you stay at your 
          father's or mother's house and see if you would be given presents or 
          not?" Then Allah's Apostle got up in the evening after the prayer, and
          having testified that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah 
          and praised and glorified Allah as He deserved, he said, "Now then ! 
          What about an employee whom we employ and then he comes and says, 
          'This amount (of Zakat) is for you, and this (amount) was given to me 
          as a present'? Why didn't he stay at the house of his father and 
          mother to see if he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose 
          Hand Muhammad's soul is, none of you will steal anything of it (i.e. 
          Zakat) but will bring it by carrying it over his neck on the Day of 
          Resurrection. If it has been a camel, he will bring it (over his neck)
          while it will be grunting, and if it has been a cow, he will bring it 
          (over his neck), while it will be mooing; and if it has been a sheep, 
          he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be bleeding." The 
          Prophet added, "I have preached you (Allah's Message)." Abu Humaid 
          said, "Then Allah's Apostle raised his hands so high that we saw the 
          whiteness of his armpits."

          willing. Solomon then slept with all the women, but none of them

          have fought in Allah's Cause as cavaliers. "

          then a meal containing chicken was brought to Abu Musa, and there was

          it filthy and took an oath that I would never eat chicken." On that, 
          Abu Musa said, "Get up, I will narrate to you about that. Once a group
          of the Ash'ariyin and I went to Allah's Apostle and asked him to 
          provide us with mounts; he said, 'By Allah, I will never give you any

          war booty were brought to Allah's Apostle , and he asked about us,

          to be given to us, and when we had departed, we said, 'What have we 
          done? Allah's Apostle had taken the oath not to give us any mounts, 
          and that he had nothing to mount us on, and later he gave us that we

          took an oath that you would not give us any mounts and that you had 
          nothing to mount us on.' On that he said, 'I did not provide you with

          and then find something else better than it, I do that which is better

        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
        <p> 'Umar said "O Allah's Apostle! I vowed to perform I'tikaf for one 
          night in Al-Masjid-al-Haram, during the Pre-Islamic Period of 
          ignorance (before embracing Islam). "The Prophet said, "Fulfill your 
          vow." Ibn 'Umar said to the lady, "Pray on her behalf." Ibn 'Abbas 
          said the same.

        <p> Narrated Sa'id bin 'Ubada Al-Ansari:
        <p> that he consulted the Prophet about a vow that had been made by his 
          mother who died without fulfilling it. The Prophet gave his verdict 
          that he should fulfill it on her behalf. The verdict became Sunna 
          (i.e. the Prophet's tradition).

        <p> A man came to the Prophet and said to him, "My sister vowed to perform
          the Hajj, but she died (before fulfilling it)." The Prophet said, 
          "Would you not have paid her debts if she had any?" The man said, 
          "Yes." The Prophet said, "So pay Allah's Rights, as He is more 
          entitled to receive His rights."

          come in the shade, nor speak to anybody, and will fast.'' The Prophet

          'Abdullah bin 'Umar said: You have indeed a good example in Allah's 
          Apostle. He did not fast on the day of 'Id al Adha or the day of 
          'Id-al-Fitr, and we do not intend fasting on these two days.

          coincided with the day of Nahr (the first day of 'Id-al-Adha), (What 
          shall I do?)" Ibn 'Umar said, "Allah has ordered the vows to be 
          fulfilled, and we are forbidden to fast on the day of Nahr." The man 
          repeated his question and Ibn 'Umar repeated his former answer, adding
          nothing more.

        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> We went out in the company of Allah's Apostle on the day of (the 
          battle of) Khaibar, and we did not get any gold or silver as war 
          booty, but we got property in the form of things and clothes. Then a 
          man called Rifa'a bin Zaid, from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dubaib, 
          presented a slave named Mid'am to Allah's Apostle. Allah's Apostle 
          headed towards the valley of Al-Qura, and when he was in the valley of
          Al-Qura an arrow was thrown by an unidentified person, struck and 
          killed Mid'am who was making a she-camel of Allah's Apostle kneel 
          down. The people said, "Congratulations to him (the slave) for gaining
          Paradise." Allah's Apostle said, "No! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is,
          for the sheet which he stole from the war booty before its 
          distribution on the day of Khaibar, is now burning over him." When the
          people heard that, a man brought one or two Shiraks (leather straps of
          shoes) to the Prophet. The Prophet said, "A Shirak of fire, or two 
          Shiraks of fire."
