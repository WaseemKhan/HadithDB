        <p> Ya'la used to say, "I wish I could see Allah's Apostle at the time he 
          is being inspired Divinely." When the Prophet was at Al-Ja'rana and 
          was shaded by a garment hanging over him and some of his companions 
          were with him, a man perfumed with scent came and said, "O Allah's 
          Apostle! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and 
          puts on a cloak after perfuming his body with scent?" The Prophet 
          waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon 
          him. 'Umar pointed out to Ya'la, telling him to come. Ya'la came and 
          pushed his head (underneath the screen which was covering the Prophet 
          ) and behold! The Prophet's face was red and he kept on breathing 
          heavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, 
          "Where is the questioner who asked me about 'Umra a while ago?" The 
          man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet who said (to 
          him), "As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you 
          must wash it off thrice, and as for your cloak, you must take it off; 
          and then perform in your 'Umra all those things which you perform in 
          Hajj."

        <p> Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:
        <p> Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been 
          killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against 
          Musailama). (I went to him) and found 'Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting 
          with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), "Umar has come to me and said: 
          "Casualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the! Qur'an (i.e. those who
          knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am
          afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on 
          other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost. 
          Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur'an be 
          collected." I said to 'Umar, "How can you do something which Allah's 
          Apostle did not do?" 'Umar said, "By Allah, that is a good project. 
          "Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my 
          chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar 
          had realized." Then Abu Bakr said (to me). 'You are a wise young man 
          and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the 
          Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle. So you should search for (the 
          fragmentary scripts of) the Qur'an and collect it in one book)." By 
          Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would 
          not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the 
          Qur'an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, "How will you do something which 
          Allah's Apostle did not do?" Abu Bakr replied, "By Allah, it is a good
          project." Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah 
          opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and 
          'Umar. So I started looking for the Qur'an and collecting it from 
          (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from 
          the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat 
          At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find 
          it with anybody other than him. The Verse is:
        <p> 'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst 
          yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or 
          difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa' (At-Tauba) (9.128-129) Then 
          the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur'an remained with Abu Bakr 
          till he died, then with 'Umar till the end of his life, and then with 
          Hafsa, the daughter of 'Umar.

        <p> Narrated Anas bin Malik:
        <p> Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the time when the people of 
          Sham and the people of Iraq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and 
          Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq)
          differences in the recitation of the Qur'an, so he said to 'Uthman, "O
          chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the 
          Book (Quran) as Jews and the Christians did before." So 'Uthman sent a
          message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so 
          that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and 
          return the manuscripts to you." Hafsa sent it to 'Uthman. 'Uthman then
          ordered Zaid bin Thabit, 'Abdullah bin AzZubair, Said bin Al-As and 
          'AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in 
          perfect copies. 'Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, "In case you 
          disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur'an, then write 
          it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur'an was revealed in their 
          tongue." They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman 
          returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. 'Uthman sent to every 
          Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all
          the other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary 
          manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Said bin Thabit added, "A Verse
          from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Qur'an and I used
          to hear Allah's Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found 
          it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. (That Verse was): 'Among the 
          Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Allah.'

        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-As:
        <p> My father got me married to a lady of a noble family, and often used 
          to ask my wife about me, and she used to reply, "What a wonderful man 
          he is! He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he 
          married me." When this state continued for a long period, my father 
          told the story to the Prophet who said to my father, "Let me meet 
          him." Then I met him and he asked me, "How do you fast?" I replied, "I
          fast daily," He asked, "How long does it take you to finish the 
          recitation of the whole Quran?" I replied, "I finish it every night." 
          On that he said, "Fast for three days every month and recite the 
          Qur'an (and finish it) in one month." I said, "But I have power to do 
          more than that." He said, "Then fast for three days per week." I said,
          "i have the power to do more than that." He said, "Therefore, fast the
          most superior type of fasting, (that is, the fasting of (prophet) 
          David who used to fast every alternate day; and finish the recitation 
          of the whole Qur'an In seven days." I wish I had accepted the 
          permission of Allah's Apostle as I have become a weak old man. It is 
          said that 'Abdullah used to recite one-seventh of the Qur'an during 
          the day-time to some of his family members, for he used to check his 
          memorization of what he would recite at night during the daytime so 
          that it would be easier for him to read at night. And whenever he 
          wanted to gain some strength, he used to give up fasting for some days
          and count those days to fast for a similar period, for he disliked to 
          leave those things which he used to do during the lifetime of the 
          Prophet.
