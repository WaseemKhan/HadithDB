          <p> 'Abdullah bin Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of 
            Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He 
            said, "I slept across the bed, and Allah's Apostle along with his wife
            slept lengthwise. Allah's Apostle slept till mid-night or slightly 
            before or after it. Then Allah's Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the
            traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited 
            the last ten verses of Surat-Al Imran (2). Then he went towards a 
            hanging leather water-container and performed a perfect ablution and 
            then stood up for prayer." 'Abdullah bin Abbas added, "I got up and 
            did the same as Allah's Apostle had done and then went and stood by 
            his side. Allah's Apostle then put his right hand over my head and 
            caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two 
            Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat 
            and then offered one Raka Witr. Then he lay down till the Muadh-dhin 
            came and then he prayed two light Rakat and went out and offered the 
            early morning (Fajr) prayer."

            answer our greetings. When we returned from AnNajashi (the ruler of 
            Ethiopia), we greeted him, but he did not answer us (during the 
            prayer) and (after finishing the prayer) he said, "In the prayer one

          <p> The Prophet went out to affect a reconciliation between the tribes of 
            Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf and the time of the prayer became due; Bilal went 
            to Abu Bakr and said, "The Prophet is detained. Will you lead the 
            people in the prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, "Yes, if you wish." So Bilal 
            pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the 
            Prophet came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood 
            in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never 
            looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people 
            clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) 
            row. The Prophet waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised
            both his hands and sent praises to Allah and then retreated and the 
            Prophet went forward and led the prayer. (See Hadith No. 295 & 296)

            Allah and all the prayers and all the good things (are for Allah). 
            Peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings (are on 
            you). And peace be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Allah. 
            I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that 
            Muhammad is His slave and Apostle.) So, when you have said this, then 
            you have surely sent the greetings to every good (pious) worship per 
            of Allah, whether he be in the Heaven or on the Earth . "

            Monday, the Prophet came towards them suddenly having lifted the 
            curtain of 'Aisha's house, and looked at them as they were standing in
            rows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah's 
            Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the 
            Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to 
            see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their 
            prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The 
            Prophet expired on that very day.

            hermitage and said, 'O Juraij' He said, 'O Allah, my mother (is 
            calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer (what shall I do)?' She 
            again said, 'O Juraij!' He said again, 'O Allah ! My mother (is

            me) and (I am offering) my prayer. (What shall I do?)' She said, 'O 
            Allah! Do not let Juraij die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.' A
            shepherdess used to come by his hermitage for grazing her sheep and 
            she gave birth to a child. She was asked whose child that was, and she
            replied that it was from Juraij and that he had come out from his 
            hermitage. Juraij said, 'Where is that woman who claims that her child
            is from me?' (When she was brought to him along with the child), 
            Juraij asked the child, 'O Babus, who is your father?' The child 
            replied, 'The shepherd.' " (See Hadith No 662. Vol 3).

            was delayed there, and the time of the prayer was due. Bilal went to 
            Abu Bakr and said to him, "Allah's Apostle has been delayed (there) 
            and the time of prayer is due. So will you lead the people in prayer?"
            Abu Bakr said, "Yes, if you wish." Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu 
            Bakr, went forward and said Takbir for the people. In the mean-time 
            Allah's Apostle came crossing the rows (of the praying people) and 
            stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, 
            would never glance side-ways in his prayer but when the people clapped
            much he looked back and (saw) Allah's Apostle . Allah's Apostle 
            beckoned him to carry on the prayer. Abu Bakr raised his hands and 
            thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah's 
            Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he 
            completed the prayer he faced the people and said, "O people! Why did 
            you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the 
            prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes 
            across something in the prayer should say, 'Subhan-Allah' for there is
            none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O 
            Ab-u Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer 
            when I beckoned you to do so?" Abu Bakr replied, "How dare the son of 
            Abu Quhafa lead the prayer in the presence of Allah's Apostle ?"

          <p> I went to 'Aisha and she was standing praying and the people, too, 
            were standing (praying). So I said, "What is the matter with the

          <p> Allah's Apostle during his illness prayed in his house sitting, 
            whereas some people followed him standing, but the Prophet beckoned 
            them to sit down. On completion of the prayer he said, "The Imam is to
            be followed. So, bow when he bows, and raise your head when he raises 
            his head." (See Hadith No. 657 Vol 1 for taking the verdict).
