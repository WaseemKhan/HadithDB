          <p> Narrated Al-Bara:
          <p> Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from 'Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu 
            Bakr said to 'Azib, "Tell Al-Bara' to carry the saddle for me." 'Azib 
            said, "No, unless you relate to me what happened to you and Allah 's 
            Apostle when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you." 
            Abu Bakr said, "We left Mecca and we travel led continuously for that 
            night and the following day till it was midday. I looked (around) 
            searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a 
            rock, and found a little shade there. So I cleaned the place and 
            spread a bed for the Prophet in the shade and said to him, 'Lie down, 
            O Allah's Apostle.' So the Prophet lay down and I went out, looking 
            around to see if there was any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a 
            shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking what we had 
            already sought from it. I asked him, 'To whom do you belong, O boy?' 
            He said, 'I belong to a man from Quraish.' He named the man and I 
            recognized him. I asked him, 'Is there any milk with your sheep?' He 
            said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you then milk (some) for us?' He said, 
            'Yes.' Then I asked him to tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean 
            its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from dust. Then the
            shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. 
            After doing so, he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for 
            Allah's Apostle a leather water-container, the mouth of which was 
            covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container 
            till its lower part was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet whom
            I found awake. I said to him, 'Drink, O Allah's Apostle.' So he drank 
            till I became pleased. Then I said, 'It is time for us to move, O 
            Allahs Apostle!' He said, 'Yes.' So we set out while the people (i.e. 
            Quraish pagans) were searching for us, but none found us except 
            Suraiqa bin Malik bin Jushum who was riding his horse. I said, 'These 
            are our pursuers who have found us. O Allah's Apostle!' He said, 'Do 
            not grieve, for Allah is with us."

            to a slave to choose this world or what is with Him. The slave has 
            chosen what is with Allah." Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonished at 
            his weeping caused by what the Prophet mentioned as to a Slave ( of 
            Allah) who had been offered a choice, (we learned later on) that 
            Allah's Apostle himself was the person who was given the choice, and 
            that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Allah's Apostle added, "The 
            person who has favored me most of all both with his company and 
            wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than my Lord, I 
            would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the 
            Islamic brotherhood and friendliness. All the gates of the Mosque 
            should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr."

            is why I have come to you." The Prophet said thrice, "O Abu Bakr! May 
            Allah forgive you." In the meanwhile, 'Umar regretted (his refusal of 
            Abu Bakr's excuse) and went to Abu Bakr's house and asked if Abu Bakr 
            was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet and
            greeted him, but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the 
            Prophet till Abu Bakr pitied ('Umar), so he knelt and said twice, "O 
            Allah's Apostle! By Allah! I was more unjust to him (than he to me)." 
            The Prophet said, "Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but

          <p> (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle died while Abu Bakr was at a
            place called As-Sunah (Al-'Aliya) 'Umar stood up and said, "By Allah! 
            Allah's Apostle is not dead!" 'Umar (later on) said, "By Allah! 
            Nothing occurred to my mind except that." He said, "Verily! Allah will
            resurrect him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men." Then 
            Abu Bakr came and uncovered the face of Allah's Apostle, kissed him 
            and said, "Let my mother and father be sacrificed for you, (O Allah's 
            Apostle), you are good in life and in death. By Allah in Whose Hands 
            my life is, Allah will never make you taste death twice." Then he went
            out and said, "O oath-taker! Don't be hasty." When Abu Bakr spoke, 
            'Umar sat down. Abu Bakr praised and glorified Allah and said, No 
            doubt! Whoever worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever
            worshipped Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die." Then he 
            recited Allah's Statement.:-- "(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and 
            they also will die." (39.30) He also recited:--
          <p> "Muhammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have 
            passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn 
            back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least 
            Harm will he do to Allah And Allah will give reward to those Who are 
            grateful." (3.144)
          <p> The people wept loudly, and the Ansar were assembled with Sad bin 
            'Ubada in the shed of Bani Saida. They said (to the emigrants). "There
            should be one 'Amir from us and one from you." Then Abu Bakr, Umar bin
            Al-Khattab and Abu 'baida bin Al-Jarrah went to them. 'Umar wanted to 
            speak but Abu Bakr stopped him. 'Umar later on used to say, "By Allah,
            I intended only to say something that appealed to me and I was afraid 
            that Abu Bakr would not speak so well. Then Abu Bakr spoke and his 
            speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, "We are the rulers
            and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers)," Hubab bin 
            Al-Mundhir said, "No, by Allah we won't accept this. But there must be
            a ruler from us and a ruler from you." Abu Bakr said, "No, we will be 
            the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are 
            the best family amongst the 'Arabs and of best origin. So you should 
            elect either 'Umar or Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler." 'Umar 
            said (to Abu Bakr), "No but we elect you, for you are our chief and 
            the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Allah's 
            Apostle." So 'Umar took Abu Bakr's hand and gave the pledge of 
            allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu 
            Bakr. Someone said, "You have killed Sad bin Ubada." 'Umar said, 
            "Allah has killed him." 'Aisha said (in another narration), ("When the
            Prophet was on his death-bed) he looked up and said thrice, (Amongst) 
            the Highest Companion (See Qur'an 4.69)' Aisha said, Allah benefited 
            the people by their two speeches. 'Umar frightened the people some of 
            whom were hypocrites whom Allah caused to abandon Islam because of 
            'Umar's speech. Then Abu Bakr led the people to True Guidance and 
            acquainted them with the right path they were to follow so that they 
            went out reciting:-- "Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed 
            many Apostles have passed away before him.." (3.144)

            (in his service)." I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet .

            while Allah's Apostle was smiling, 'Umar said "O Allah's Apostle! May 
            Allah always keep you smiling." The Prophet said, "These women who 
            have been here, roused my wonder, for as soon as they heard your 
            voice, they quickly put on their veils. "'Umar said, "O Allah's 
            Apostle! You have more right to be feared by them than I." Then 'Umar 
            addressed the women saying, "O enemies of yourselves! You fear me more
            than you do Allah's Apostle ?" They said, "Yes, for you are harsher 
            and sterner than Allah's Apostle." Then Allah's Apostle said, "O Ibn 
            Al-Khattab! By Him in Whose Hands my life is! Never does Satan find 
            you going on a way, but he takes another way other than yours."

            stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the 
            Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been 
            captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, 'Umar held the hand of 
            'Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer. 
          <p> Those who were standing by the side of 'Umar saw what I saw, but the 
            people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything,
            but they lost the voice of 'Umar and they were saying, "Subhan Allah! 
            Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah)." Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the
            people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, 'Umar said, "O 
            Ibn 'Abbas! Find out who attacked me." Ibn 'Abbas kept on looking here
            and there for a short time and came to say. "The slave of Al Mughira."
            On that 'Umar said, "The craftsman?" Ibn 'Abbas said, "Yes." 'Umar 
            said, "May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the 
            Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a 
            man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father 
            (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina." 
            Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn 'Abbas said to 'Umar. 
            "If you wish, we will do." He meant, "If you wish we will kill them." 
            'Umar said, "You are mistaken (for you can't kill them) after they 
            have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed 
            Hajj like yours." 
          <p> Then Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and 
            the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some 
            said, "Do not worry (he will be Alright soon)." Some said, "We are 
            afraid (that he will die)." Then an infusion of dates was brought to 
            him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then 
            milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his 
            belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the 
            people came, praising him. A young man came saying, "O chief of the 
            believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your 
            company with Allah's Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you 
            know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with 
            justice and finally you have been martyred." 'Umar said, "I wish that 
            all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I 
            will neither lose nor gain anything." 
          <p> When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be 
            touching the ground. 'Umar said, "Call the young man back to me." 
            (When he came back) 'Umar said, "O son of my brother! Lift your 
            clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the 
            Punishment of your Lord." 'Umar further said, "O 'Abdullah bin 'Umar! 
            See how much I am in debt to others." When the debt was checked, it 
            amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. 'Umar said, "If the 
            property of 'Umar's family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof;
            otherwise request it from Bani 'Adi bin Ka'b, and if that too is not 
            sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from 
            any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf." 
          <p> 'Umar then said (to 'Abdullah), "Go to 'Aisha (the mother of the 
            believers) and say: "Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don't 
            say: 'The chief of the believers,' because today I am not the chief of
            the believers. And say: "Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be
            buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr)." 
            Abdullah greeted 'Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, and
            then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her,
            "'Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the 
            permission to be buried with his two companions." She said, "I had the
            idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to 
            myself." When he returned it was said (to 'Umar), "'Abdullah bin 'Umar
            has come." 'Umar said, "Make me sit up." Somebody supported him 
            against his body and 'Umar asked ('Abdullah), "What news do you have?"
            He said, "O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given 
            the permission." 'Umar said, "Praise be to Allah, there was nothing 
            more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet 
            'Aisha and say: "Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried
            with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, 
            and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims." 
          <p> Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women 
            walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to 
            'Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission 
            to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping 
            inside. The people said (to 'Umar), "O chief of the believers! Appoint
            a successor." Umar said, "I do not find anyone more suitable for the 
            job than the following persons or group whom Allah's Apostle had been 
            pleased with before he died." Then 'Umar mentioned 'Ali, 'Uthman, 
            AzZubair, Talha, Sad and 'Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, "Abdullah 
            bin 'Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the 
            rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the 
            right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: 
            otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have 
            not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty." 'Umar added, 
            "I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to 
            know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. 
          <p> I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina 
            before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. 
            I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous 
            among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he 
            should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are 
            the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of 
            annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from 
            them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend 
            that he do good to the 'Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the 
            'Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is 
            inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor 
            amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah's and His 
            Apostle's protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to 
            fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their 
            ability." So when 'Umar expired, we carried him out and set out 
            walking. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar greeted ('Aisha) and said, "'Umar bin 
            Al-Khattab asks for the permission." 'Aisha said, "Bring him in." He 
            was brought in and buried beside his two companions. 
          <p> When he was buried, the group (recommended by 'Umar) held a meeting. 
            Then 'Abdur-Rahman said, " Reduce the candidates for rulership to 
            three of you." Az-Zubair said, "I give up my right to Ali." Talha 
            said, "I give up my right to 'Uthman," Sad, 'I give up my right to 
            'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf." 'Abdur-Rahman then said (to 'Uthman and 
            'Ali), "Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy 
            to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in 
            mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses." So both the sheiks 
            (i.e. 'Uthman and 'Ali) kept silent. 'Abdur-Rahman said, "Will you 
            both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I 
            will not choose but the better of you?" They said, "Yes." So 
            'Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. 'Ali) and said, "You 
            are related to Allah's Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you 
            know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a 
            ruler you will do justice, and if I select 'Uthman as a ruler you will
            listen to him and obey him." Then he took the other (i.e. 'Uthman) 
            aside and said the same to him. When 'Abdur-Rahman secured (their 
            agreement to) this covenant, he said, "O 'Uthman! Raise your hand." So
            he (i.e. 'Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. 'Uthman) the solemn pledge, and
            then 'Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) 
            people gave him the pledge of allegiance.

            The next morning the people went to Allah's Apostle and every one of 
            them hoped that he would be given the flag. The Prophet said, "Where 
            is Ali bin Abi Talib?" The people replied, "He is suffering from eye 
            trouble, O Allah's Apostle." He said, "Send for him and bring him to 
            me." So when 'Ali came, the Prophet spat in his eyes and invoked good 
            on him, and he became alright as if he had no ailment. The Prophet 
            then gave him the flag. 'Ali said, "O Allah's Apostle! Shall I fight 
            them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?" The Prophet said, 
            "Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then 
            invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah 
            which Islam prescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on
            the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be

            turn. 'Aisha said, "My companions (i.e. the other wives of the 
            Prophet) gathered in the house of Um Salama and said, "0 Um Salama! By
            Allah, the people choose to send presents on the day of 'Aisha's turn 
            and we too, love the good (i.e. presents etc.) as 'Aisha does. You 
            should tell Allah's Apostle to tell the people to send their presents 
            to him wherever he may be, or wherever his turn may be." Um Salama 
            said that to the Prophet and he turned away from her, and when the 
            Prophet returned to her (i.e. Um Salama), she repeated the same, and 
            the Prophet again turned away, and when she told him the same for the 
            third time, the Prophet said, "O Um Salama! Don't trouble me by 
            harming 'Aisha, for by Allah, the Divine Inspiration never came to me 
            while I was under the blanket of any woman amongst you except her."
