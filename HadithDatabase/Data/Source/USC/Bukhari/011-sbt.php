        <p> Narrated Anas:
        <p> The people mentioned the fire and the bell (they suggested those as 
          signals to indicate the starting of prayers), and by that they 
          mentioned the Jews and the Christians. Then Bilal was ordered to 
          pronounce Adhan for the prayer by saying its wordings twice, and for 
          the Iqama (the call for the actual standing for the prayers in rows) 
          by saying its wordings once. (Iqama is pronounced when the people are 
          ready for the prayer).

        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
        <p> When the Muslims arrived at Medina, they used to assemble for the 
          prayer, and used to guess the time for it. During those days, the 
          practice of Adhan for the prayers had not been introduced yet. Once 
          they discussed this problem regarding the call for prayer. Some people
          suggested the use of a bell like the Christians, others proposed a 
          trumpet like the horn used by the Jews, but 'Umar was the first to 
          suggest that a man should call (the people) for the prayer; so Allah's
          Apostle ordered Bilal to get up and pronounce the Adhan for prayers.

        <p> Bilal was ordered to repeat the wording of the Adhan for prayers 
          twice, and to pronounce the wording of the Iqamas once except 
          "Qad-qamat-is-Salat".

        <p> Narrated Anas bin Malik:
        <p> When the number of Muslims increased they discussed the question as to
          how to know the time for the prayer by some familiar means. Some 
          suggested that a fire be lit (at the time of the prayer) and others 
          put forward the proposal to ring the bell. Bilal was ordered to 
          pronounce the wording of Adhan twice and of the Iqama once only.

          heels and passes wind with noise during his flight in order not to 
          hear the Adhan. When the Adhan is completed he comes back and again 
          takes to his heels when the Iqama is pronounced and after its 
          completion he returns again till he whispers into the heart of the 
          person (to divert his attention from his prayer) and makes him 
          remember things which he does not recall to his mind before the prayer
          and that causes him to forget how much he has prayed."

        <p> Narrated Humaid:
        <p> Anas bin Malik said, "Whenever the Prophet went out with us to fight 
          (in Allah's cause) against any nation, he never allowed us to attack 
          till morning and he would wait and see: if he heard Adhan he would 
          postpone the attack and if he did not hear Adhan he would attack 
          them." Anas added, "We reached Khaibar at night and in the morning 
          when he did not hear the Adhan for the prayer, he (the Prophet ) rode 
          and I rode behind Abi Talha and my foot was touching that of the 
          Prophet.
        <p> The inhabitants of Khaibar came out with their baskets and spades and 
          when they saw the Prophet they shouted 'Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad 
          and his army.' When Allah's Apostle saw them, he said, "Allahu-Akbar! 
          Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach a (hostile) 
          nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning of those who have 
          been warned."

        <p> The Prophet said, "The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you

          one offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from among you might 
          hurry up and the sleeping from among you might wake up. It does not 
          mean that dawn or morning has started." Then he (the Prophet) pointed 
          with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered
          them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas'ud imitated the gesture of
          the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he 
          put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These
          gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and 
          right horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers 
          down is not the real dawn) .

        <p> I went to 'Aisha and asked her to describe to me the illness of 
          Allah's Apostle. 'Aisha said, "Yes. The Prophet became seriously ill 
          and asked whether the people had prayed. We replied, 'No. O Allah's 
          Apostle! They are waiting for you.' He added, 'Put water for me in a 
          trough." 'Aisha added, "We did so. He took a bath and tried to get up 
          but fainted. When he recovered, he again asked whether the people had 
          prayed. We said, 'No, they are waiting for you. O Allah's Apostle,' He
          again said, 'Put water in a trough for me.' He sat down and took a 
          bath and tried to get up but fainted again. Then he recovered and 
          said, 'Have the people prayed?' We replied, 'No, they are waiting for 
          you. O Allah's Apostle.' He said, 'Put water for me in the trough.' 
          Then he sat down and washed himself and tried to get up but he 
          fainted. When he recovered, he asked, 'Have the people prayed?' We 
          said, 'No, they are waiting for you. O Allah's Apostle! The people 
          were in the mosque waiting for the Prophet for the 'Isha prayer. The 
          Prophet sent for Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer. The 
          messenger went to Abu Bakr and said, 'Allah's Apostle orders you to 
          lead the people in the prayer.' Abu Bakr was a soft-hearted man, so he
          asked 'Umar to lead the prayer but 'Umar replied, 'You are more 
          rightful.' So Abu Bakr led the prayer in those days. When the Prophet 
          felt a bit better, he came out for the Zuhr prayer with the help of 
          two persons one of whom was Al-'Abbas. while Abu Bakr was leading the 
          people in the prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him he wanted to retreat but 
          the Prophet beckoned him not to do so and asked them to make him sit 
          beside Abu Bakr and they did so. Abu Bakr was following the Prophet 
          (in the prayer) and the people were following Abu Bakr. The Prophet 
          (prayed) sitting."
        <p> 'Ubaid-Ullah added "I went to 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and asked him, 
          Shall I tell you what Aisha has told me about the fatal illness of the
          Prophet?' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'Go ahead. I told him her narration and he 
          did not deny anything of it but asked whether 'Aisha told me the name 
          of the second person (who helped the Prophet ) along with Al-Abbas. I 
          said. 'No.' He said, 'He was 'Ali (Ibn Abi Talib).

        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> Once Allah's Apostle prayed two Rakat (instead of four) and finished 
          his prayer. Dhu-l-yadain asked him whether the prayer had been reduced
          or whether he had forgotten. Allah's Apostle asked the people whether 
          Dhu-l-yadain was telling the truth. The people replied in the 
          affirmative. Then Allah's Apostle stood up, offered the remaining two 
          Rakat and then finished his prayer with Taslim and then said, "Allahu 
          Akbar." He followed it with two prostrations like ordinary 
          prostrations or a bit longer.

        <p> the mother of the faithful believers: Allah's Apostle in his last 
          illness said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer." I 
          said, "If Abu Bakr stood in your place, he would not be able to make 
          the people hear him owing to his weeping. So please order 'Umar to 
          lead the prayer." He said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the 
          prayer." I said to Hafsa, "Say to him, 'Abu Bakr is a softhearted man 
          and if he stood in your place he would not be able to make the people 
          hear him owing to his weeping. So order 'Umar to lead the people in

          Verily you are the companions of (Prophet) Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to 
          lead the people in the prayer." Hafsa said to me, "I never got any
