        <p> Some Muslim men emigrated to Ethiopia whereupon Abu Bakr also prepared
          himself for the emigration, but the Prophet said (to him), "Wait, for 
          I hope that Allah will allow me also to emigrate." Abu Bakr said, "Let
          my father and mother be sacrificed for you. Do you hope that 
          (emigration)?" The Prophet said, 'Yes." So Abu Bakr waited to 
          accompany the Prophet and fed two she-camels he had on the leaves of 
          As-Samur tree regularly for four months One day while we were sitting 
          in our house at midday, someone said to Abu Bakr, "Here is Allah's 
          Apostle, coming with his head and a part of his face covered with a 
          cloth-covering at an hour he never used to come to us." Abu Bakr said,
          "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you, (O Prophet)! An 
          urgent matter must have brought you here at this hour." The Prophet 
          came and asked the permission to enter, and he was allowed. The 
          Prophet entered and said to Abu Bakr, "Let those who are with you, go 
          out." Abu Bakr replied, "(There is no stranger); they are your family.
          Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet 
          said, "I have been allowed to leave (Mecca)." Abu Bakr said, " I shall
          accompany you, O Allah's Apostles, Let my father be sacrificed for 
          you!" The Prophet said, "Yes," Abu Bakr said, 'O Allah's Apostles! Let

          mine" The Prophet said. I will take it only after paying its price." 
          So we prepared their baggage and put their journey food In a leather 
          bag. And Asma' bint Abu Bakr cut a piece of her girdle and tied the 
          mouth of the leather bag with it. That is why she was called 
          Dhat-an-Nitaqaln. Then the Prophet and Abu Bakr went to a cave in a 
          mountain called Thour and remained there for three nights. 'Abdullah 
          bin Abu Bakr. who was a young intelligent man. used to stay with them 
          at night and leave before dawn so that in the morning, he would he 
          with the Quraish at Mecca as if he had spent the night among them. If 
          he heard of any plot contrived by the Quraish against the Prophet and 
          Abu Bakr, he would understand it and (return to) inform them of it 
          when it became dark. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr 
          used to graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he used to take 
          those sheep to them when an hour had passed after the 'Isha prayer. 
          They would sleep soundly till 'Amir bin Fuhaira awakened them when it 
          was still dark. He used to do that in each of those three nights.

        <p> For one year I wanted to ask 'Umar about the two women who helped each
          other against the Prophet but I was afraid of him. One day he 
          dismounted his riding animal and went among the trees of Arak to 
          answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I asked him and he 
          said, "(They were) 'Aisha and Hafsa." Then he added, "We never used to
          give significance to ladies in the days of the Pre-lslamic period of 
          ignorance, but when Islam came and Allah mentioned their rights, we 
          used to give them their rights but did not allow them to interfere in 
          our affairs. Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and 
          she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, 'Strange! You can
          retort in this way?' She said, 'Yes. Do you say this to me while your 
          daughter troubles Allah's Apostle?' So I went to Hafsa and said to 
          her, 'I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.' I first went 
          to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, 
          'O 'Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much 
          that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Allah's Apostle
          and his wives.' So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; 
          whenever he was absent from Allah's Apostle and I was present there, I
          used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was 
          absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had 
          happened as regards news from Allah's Apostle . During that time all 
          the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah's Apostle 
          except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might 
          attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, 'A great event 
          has happened!' I asked him, 'What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) 
          come?' He said, 'Greater than that! Allah's Apostle has divorced his 
          wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their 
          dwellings, and the Prophet had ascended to an upper room of his. At 
          the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, "Ask 
          the permission for me to enter." He admitted me and I entered to see 
          the Prophet  lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. 
          Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. 
          Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for 
          tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and 
          what reply Um Salama had given me. Allah's Apostle smiled and stayed 
          there for twenty nine days and then came down." (See 
          Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)
