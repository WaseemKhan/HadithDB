            of the Quran): 'They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not 
            in the way of Allah.' (9.34). Muawiya said, 'This verse is revealed 
            regarding the people of the scriptures." I said, It was revealed 
            regarding us and also the people of the scriptures." So we had a 
            quarrel and Mu'awiya sent a complaint against me to 'Uthman. 'Uthman 
            wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came 
            to me as if they had not seen me before. So I told this to 'Uthman who
            said to me, "You may depart and live nearby if you wish." That was the
            reason for my being here for even if an Ethiopian had been nominated

            rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, 
            greeted us and said, "Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will
            be heated in the Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their 
            breasts till it comes out from the bones of their shoulders and then 
            put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the nipples

            that, the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I 
            followed him and sat beside him, and I did not know who he was. I said
            to him, "I think the people disliked what you had said." He said, 
            "These people do not understand anything, although my friend told me."
            I asked, "Who is your friend?" He said, "The Prophet said (to me), 'O 
            Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?' And on that I (Abu Dhar) 
            started looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day 
            as I thought that Allah's Apostle wanted to send me to do something 
            for him and I said, 'Yes!' He said, 'I do not love to have gold equal

            except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and

            about the prevalence of robberies. Allah's Apostle said, "As regards 
            stealing and robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan 
            will go to Mecca (from Medina) without any guard. And regarding 
            poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be established till one 
            of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find 
            anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in 
            front of Allah and there will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter 
            between him and Allah, and Allah will ask him, 'Did not I give you 
            wealth?' He will reply in the affirmative. Allah will further ask, 
            'Didn't I send a messenger to you?' And again that person will reply in 
            the affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing
            but Hell-fire, and then he will look to his left and will see nothing 
            but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you should save himself from 
            the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if you 
            do not find a half date-fruit, then (you can do it through saying) a 
            good pleasant word (to your brethren). (See Hadith No. 793 Vol. 4).

          <p> from his father from his grandfather that the Prophet said, "Every 
            Muslim has to give in charity." The people asked, "O Allah's Prophet! 
            If someone has nothing to give, what will he do?" He said, "He should

            to me the following:-- (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the 
            Merciful). These are the orders for compulsory charity (Zakat) which 
            Allah's Apostle had made obligatory for every Muslim, and which Allah 
            had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever amongst the Muslims is 
            asked to pay Zakat accordingly, he should pay it (to the Zakat 
            collector) and whoever is asked more than that (what is specified in

            one Bint Makhad is to be paid; and if they are between thirty-six to 
            forty-five (camels), one Bint Labun is to be paid; and if they are 
            between forty-six to sixty (camels), one Hiqqa is to be paid; and if

            is to be paid; and if the number is between seventy-six to ninety

            ninety-one to one-hundred-and twenty (camels), two Hiqqas are to be 
            paid; and if they are over one-hundred and-twenty (camels), for every 
            forty (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Bint Labun is to be paid, and 
            for every fifty camels (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Hiqqa is to 
            be paid; and who ever has got only four camels, has to pay nothing as 
            Zakat, but if the owner of these four camels wants to give something, 
            he can. If the number of camels increases to five, the owner has to 
            pay one sheep as Zakat. As regards the Zakat for the (flock) of sheep;
            if they are between forty and one-hundred-and-twenty sheep, one sheep 
            is to be paid; and if they are between one-hundred-and-twenty to two 
            hundred (sheep), two sheep are to be paid; and if they are between 
            two-hundred to three-hundred (sheep), three sheep are to be paid; and 
            for over three-hundred sheep, for every extra hundred sheep, one sheep
            is to be paid as Zakat. And if somebody has got less than forty sheep,
            no Zakat is required, but if he wants to give, he can. For silver the 
            Zakat is one-fortieth of the lot (i.e. 2.5%), and if its value is less
            than two-hundred Dirhams, Zakat is not required, but if the owner 
            wants to pay he can.'

            Prophet wiped off his sweat and said, "Where is the questioner?" It 
            seemed as if the Prophet liked his question. Then he said, "Good never
            brings forth evil. Indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a 
            water-stream which either kill or make the animals sick, except if an 
            animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces 
            the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt 
            this wealth is sweet and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from
            which he gives to the poor, the orphans and to needy travelers. (Or 
            the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever takes it 
            illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and 
            his wealth will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection."

            and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her 
            garden. The Prophet asked his companions to estimate the amount of the
            fruits in the garden, and Allah's Apostle estimated it at ten Awsuq 
            (One Wasaq = 60 Sa's) and 1 Sa'= 3 kg. approximately). The Prophet 
            said to that lady, "Check what your garden will yield." When we 
            reached Tabuk, the Prophet said, "There will be a strong wind to-night
            and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it."
            So we fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood
            up and he was blown away to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila 
            sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to the Prophet as a present,

            Wadi-al-Qura he asked that woman how much her garden had yielded. She 
            said, "Ten Awsuq," and that was what Allah's Apostle had estimated. 
            Then the Prophet said, "I want to reach Medina quickly, and whoever

            he said, "This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of

            he went to the Prophet and asked his permission. The Prophet said, "Do
            not take back what you have given in charity." For this reason, Ibn 
            'Umar never purchased the things which he had given in charity, and in
            case he had purchased something (unknowingly) he would give it in 
            charity again.

          <p> Once I gave a horse in Allah's Cause (in charity) but that person did 
            not take care of it. I intended to buy it, as I thought he would sell

            said, "Neither buy, nor take back your alms which you have given, even
            if the seller were willing to sell it for one Dirham, for he who takes
            back his alms is like the one who swallows his own vomit."
