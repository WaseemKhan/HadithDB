        <p> Allah's Apostle said, 'Nations were displayed before me; one or two 
          prophets would pass by along with a few followers. A prophet would 
          pass by accompanied by nobody. Then a big crowd of people passed in 
          front of me and I asked, Who are they Are they my followers?" It was 
          said, 'No. It is Moses and his followers It was said to me, 'Look at 
          the horizon.'' Behold! There was a multitude of people filling the 
          horizon. Then it was said to me, 'Look there and there about the 
          stretching sky! Behold! There was a multitude filling the horizon,' It
          was said to me, 'This is your nation out of whom seventy thousand 
          shall enter Paradise without reckoning.' "Then the Prophet entered his
          house without telling his companions who they (the 70,000) were. So 
          the people started talking about the issue and said, "It is we who 
          have believed in Allah and followed His Apostle; therefore those 
          people are either ourselves or our children who are born m the Islamic
          era, for we were born in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.'' When 
          the Prophet heard of that, he came out and said. "Those people are 
          those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya, nor do they believe in 
          bad or good omen (from birds etc.) nor do they get themselves branded 
          (Cauterized). but they put their trust (only) in their Lord " On that 
          'Ukasha bin Muhsin said. "Am I one of them, O Allah's Apostle?' The 
          Prophet said, "Yes." Then another person got up and said, "Am I one of
          them?" The Prophet said, 'Ukasha has anticipated you."

          companions of the Prophet started talking about that and some of them 
          said, "As regards us, we were born in the era of heathenism, but then 
          we believed in Allah and His Apostle . We think however, that these 
          (70,000) are our offspring." That talk reached the Prophet who said, 
          "These (70,000) are the people who do not draw an evil omen from 
          (birds) and do not get treated by branding themselves and do not treat
          with Ruqya, but put their trust (only) in their Lord." then 'Ukasha

          had sexual relations with his wives while he actually had not (Sufyan 
          said: That is the hardest kind of magic as it has such an effect). 
          Then one day he said, "O 'Aisha do you know that Allah has instructed 
          me concerning the matter I asked Him about? Two men came to me and one
          of them sat near my head and the other sat near my feet. The one near 
          my head asked the other. What is wrong with this man?' The latter 
          replied the is under the effect of magic The first one asked, Who has 
          worked magic on him?' The other replied Labid bin Al-A'sam, a man from
          Bani Zuraiq who was an ally of the Jews and was a hypocrite.' The 
          first one asked, What material did he use)?' The other replied, 'A 
          comb and the hair stuck to it.' The first one asked, 'Where (is 
          that)?' The other replied. 'In a skin of pollen of a male date palm 
          tree kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan' '' So the Prophet went
          to that well and took out those things and said "That was the well 
          which was shown to me (in a dream) Its water looked like the infusion 
          of Henna leaves and its date-palm trees looked like the heads of 
          devils." The Prophet added, "Then that thing was taken out' I said (to
          the Prophet ) "Why do you not treat yourself with Nashra?" He said, 
          "Allah has cured me; I dislike to let evil spread among my people."

        <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
        <p> Magic was worked on Allah's Apostle so that he began to imagine that 
          he had done something although he had not. One day while he was with 
          me, he invoked Allah and invoked for a long period and then said, "O 
          'Aisha! Do you know that Allah has instructed me regarding the matter 
          I asked Him about?" I asked, "What is that, O Allah's Apostle?" He 
          said, "Two men came to me; one of them sat near my head and the other 
          sat near my feet. One of them asked his companion, 'What is the 
          disease of this man?' The other replied, 'He is under the effect of 
          magic.' The first one asked, 'Who has worked magic on him?" The other 
          replied, 'Labid bin A'sam, a Jew from the tribe of Bani Zuraiq.' The 
          (first one asked), 'With what has it been done?' The other replied, 
          'With a a comb and the hair stuck to it and a skin of the pollen of a 
          male datepalm tree.' The first one asked, 'Where is it?' The other 
          replied, 'In the well of Dharwan.' Then the Prophet went along with 
          some of his companions to that well and looked at that and there were 
          date palms near to it. Then he returned to me and said, 'By Allah the 
          water of that well was (red) like the infusion of Henna leaves and its
          date-palms were like the heads of devils" I said, O Allah's Apostle! 
          Did you take those materials out of the pollen skin?" He said, 'No! As
          for me Allah has healed me and cured me and I was afraid that (by 
          Showing that to the people) I would spread evil among them when he 
          ordered that the well be filled up with earth, and it was filled up 
          with earth "
