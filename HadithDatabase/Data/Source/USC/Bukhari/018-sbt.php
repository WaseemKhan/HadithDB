        <p> We were with Allah's Apostle when the sun eclipsed. Allah's Apostle 
          stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the Mosque. He led us in a
          two-Rakat prayer till the sun (eclipse) had cleared. Then the Prophet 
          (p.b.u.h) said, "The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of

        <p> In the life-time of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed, so he 
          led the people in prayer, and stood up and performed a long Qiyam, 
          then bowed for a long while. He stood up again and performed a long 
          Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first.
          He bowed again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he
          prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the 
          second Raka as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by 
          then the sun (eclipse) had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) 
          and after praising and glorifying Allah he said, "The sun and the moon
          are two signs against the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the 
          death or life of anyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah 
          and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa." The Prophet then said, "O 
          followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has more ghaira 
          (self-respect) than Allah as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or
          female commit adultery (illegal sexual intercourse). O followers of 
          Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that which I know you would laugh 
          little and weep much.

          for You)" and then prostrated and did the same in the second Raka; 
          thus he completed four bowing and four prostrations. The sun (eclipse)
          had cleared before he finished the prayer. (After the prayer) he stood
          up, glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and then said, "The sun

          because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see

          Allah from the punishment of the grave (and thus replied in the

          the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood for the (eclipse)

        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abbas:
        <p> The sun eclipsed in the life-time of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) . Allah's 
          Apostle offered the eclipse prayer and stood for a long period equal 
          to the period in which one could recite Surat-al-Baqara. Then he bowed
          for a long time and then stood up for a long period which was shorter 
          than that of the first standing, then bowed again for a long time but 
          for a shorter period than the first; then he prostrated twice and then
          stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the first 
          standing; then he bowed for a long time which was shorter than the

          period which was shorter than the first standing, then he bowed for a 
          long time which was shorter than the first bowing, and then prostrated
          (twice) and finished the prayer. By then, the sun (eclipse) had 
          cleared. The Prophet then said, "The sun and the moon are two of the 
          signs of Allah. They eclipse neither because of the death of somebody 
          nor because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember 
          Allah." The people say, "O Allah's Apostle! We saw you taking 
          something from your place and then we saw you retreating." The Prophet
          replied, "I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of 
          its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long 
          as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen 
          such a horrible sight. I saw that most of the inhabitants were women."
          The people asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Why is it so?" The Prophet 
          replied, "Because of their ungratefulness." It was asked whether they 
          are ungrateful to Allah. The Prophet said, "They are ungrateful to 
          their companions of life (husbands) and ungrateful to good deeds. If 
          you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees 
          anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, 'I have never had any 
          good from you.' "

          sky and said, 'Subhan-Allah'. I said, 'Is there a sign?' She pointed

          (Masih) Ad-Dajjal. (I do not know which one of the two Asma' said.) 
          (The angels) will come to everyone of you and will ask what do you 
          know about this man (i.e. Muhammad). The believer or a firm believer 
          (I do not know which word Asma' said) will reply, 'He is Muhammad, 
          Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) who came to us with clear evidences and 
          guidance, so we accepted his teachings, believed and followed him.' 
          The angels will then say to him, 'Sleep peacefully as we knew surely 
          that you were a firm believer.' The hypocrite or doubtful person (I do
          not know which word Asma' said) will say, 'I do not know. I heard the 
          people saying something so I said it (the same).' "

        <p> Narrated 'Amra bint 'AbdurRahman:
        <p> A Jewess came to 'Aisha to ask her about something and then she said, 
          "May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave." So 
          'Aisha asked Allah's Apostle, "Would the people be punished in their 
          graves?" Allah's Apostle asked Allah's refuge from the punishment of 
          the grave (indicating an affirmative reply). Then one day Allah's 
          Apostle rode (to leave for some place) but the sun eclipsed. He 
          returned on the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings 
          (of his wives) and stood up and started offering the (eclipse) prayer 
          and the people stood behind him. He stood for a long period and then 
          performed a long bowing and then stood straight for a long period 
          which was shorter than that of the first standing, then he performed a
          prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing, then he 
          raised his head and prostrated for a long time and then stood up (for 
          the second Raka) for a long while, but the standing was shorter than 
          the standing of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing 
          which was shorter than that of the first one. He then stood up for a 
          long time but shorter than the first, then again performed a long 
          bowing which was shorter than the first and then prostrated for a 
          shorter while than that of the first prostration. Then he finished the
          prayer and delivered the sermon and) said what Allah wished; and 
          ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of 
          the grave.

          prayer and when he had finished the eclipse prayer he said the Takbir

          'al-l-ahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walaka-l-hamd." And he would again 
          start reciting. In the eclipse prayer there are four bowing and four 
          prostrations in two Rakat. Al-Auza'i and others said that they had 
          heard Az-Zuhi from 'Ursa from 'Aisha saying, "In the life-time of 
          Allah's Apostle the sun eclipsed, and he made a person to announce: 
          'Prayer in congregation.' He led the prayer and performed four bowing 
          and four prostrations in two Rakat." Narrated Al-Walid that 
          'Abdur-Rahman bin Namir had informed him that he had heard the same. 
          Ibn Shihab heard the same. Az-Zuhrl said, "I asked ('Ursa), 'What did 
          your brother 'Abdullah bin AzZubair do? He prayed two Rakat (of the 
          eclipse prayer) like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse)
          prayer in Median.' 'Ursa replied that he had missed (i.e. did not pray
          according to) the Prophet's tradition." Sulaiman bin Kathir and Sufyan
          bin Husain narrated from Az-Zuhri that the prayer for the eclipse used
          to be offered with loud recitation.
