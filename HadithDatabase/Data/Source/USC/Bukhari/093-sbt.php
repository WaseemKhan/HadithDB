          it was morning, he went to the Prophet and informed him about that as 
          if he considered that the recitation of that Sura by itself was not 
          enough. Allah's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hand my life is, it is

          with (the Sura 112): 'Say (O Muhammad): "He is Allah, the One." ' 
          (112.1) When they returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to 
          the Prophet. He said (to them), "Ask him why he does so." They asked 
          him and he said, "I do so because it mentions the qualities of the 
          Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer)." The Prophet; said

          from one of his daughters who was asking him to come and see her son 
          who was dying. The Prophet said (to the messenger), "Go back and tell 
          her that whatever Allah takes is His, and whatever He gives is His, 
          and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world). So 
          order her to be patient and hope for Allah's reward." But she sent the
          messenger to the Prophet again, swearing that he should come to her. 
          So the Prophets got up, and so did Sa'd bin 'Ubada and Mu'adh bin 
          Jabal (and went to her). When the child was brought to the Prophet his
          breath was disturbed in his chest as if it were in a water skin. On 
          that the eyes of the Prophet . became flooded with tears, whereupon 
          Sa'd said to him, "O Allah's Apostle! What is this?" The Prophet said,
          "This is mercy which Allah has put in the heart of His slaves, and 
          Allah bestows His mercy only on those of His slaves who are merciful 
          (to others)." (See Hadith No. 373, Vol. 2)

          prayer of Istikhara for each and every matter just as he used to teach
          them the Suras from the Quran He used to say, "If anyone of you 
          intends to do some thing, he should offer a two rakat prayer other 
          than the compulsory prayers, and after finishing it, he should say: O 
          Allah! I consult You, for You have all knowledge, and appeal to You to
          support me with Your Power and ask for Your Bounty, for You are able 
          to do things while I am not, and You know while I do not; and You are 
          the Knower of the Unseen. O Allah If You know It this matter (name 
          your matter) is good for me both at present and in the future, (or in 
          my religion), in my this life and in the Hereafter, then fulfill it 
          for me and make it easy for me, and then bestow Your Blessings on me 
          in that matter. O Allah! If You know that this matter is not good for 
          me in my religion, in my this life and in my coming Hereafter (or at 
          present or in the future), then divert me from it and choose for me 
          what is good wherever it may be, and make me be pleased with it." (See

          (behead him) with the blade of my sword." This news reached Allah's 
          Apostle who then said, "You people are astonished at Sa'd's Ghira. By 
          Allah, I have more Ghira than he, and Allah has more Ghira than I, and
          because of Allah's Ghira, He has made unlawful Shameful deeds and sins
          (illegal sexual intercourse etc.) done in open and in secret. And 
          there is none who likes that the people should repent to Him and beg 
          His pardon than Allah, and for this reason He sent the warners and the
          givers of good news. And there is none who likes to be praised more 
          than Allah does, and for this reason, Allah promised to grant Paradise
          (to the doers of good)." 'Abdul Malik said, "No person has more Ghira 
          than Allah."

          said, "You have given us the good news; now give us (something)."

          Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" The Prophet said, 
          "Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?"

          difficulty in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?" They said, 
          "No, O Allah's Apostle." He said, "So you will see Him, like that. 
          Allah will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection, and say, 
          'Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that 
          thing),' so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and 
          whoever worshiped the moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to 
          worship certain (other false) deities, he will follow those deities. 
          And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or its 
          hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come 
          to them and say, 'I am your Lord.' They will (deny Him and) say, 'We

          they know, and will say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'You are our
          Lord,' so they will follow Him. 
        <p> Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)' I and my followers will
          be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day 
          except the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day 
          will be, 'O Allah, save! Save!' In Hell (or over The Bridge) there 
          will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa'dan (thorny plant). Have you 
          seen As-Sa'dan? " They replied, "Yes, O Allah's Apostle!" He said, "So
          those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa'dan, but none knows how big 
          they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according
          to their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) 
          because of their (evil) deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the 
          hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be punished and then 
          relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He 
          will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then
          order the angels to take out of the Fire all those who used to worship
          none but Allah from among those whom Allah wanted to be merciful to 
          and those who testified (in the world) that none has the right to be 
          worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by 
          the marks of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat 
          up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as Allah 
          has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of prostration. They will come 
          out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of life 
          will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed 
          that comes in the mud of the torrent. 
        <p> Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and there will 
          remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person 
          among the people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, 'O my Lord! 
          Please turn my face away from the fire because its air has hurt me and
          its severe heat has burnt me.' So he will invoke Allah in the way 
          Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, 'If I 
          grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?' He will reply, 
          'No, by Your Power, (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.' He 
          will give his Lord whatever promises and covenants Allah will demand. 
        <p> So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he will face 
          Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah 
          will wish him to remain quiet, then he will say, 'O my Lord! Bring me 
          near to the gate of Paradise.' Allah will say to him, 'Didn't you give
          your promises and covenants that you would never ask for anything more
          than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam's son! How

        <p> Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then Allah will

          as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he will say, O my 
          Lord! Admit me into Paradise.' Allah will say, 'Didn't you give your

          what you had been given?' Allah will say, 'Woe on you, O Adam's son!

        <p> The man will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most miserable of 
          Your creation,' and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will 
          laugh because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of 
          him, He will say to him, 'Enter Paradise,' and when he will enter it, 
          Allah will say to him, 'Wish for anything.' So he will ask his Lord, 
          and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself will 
          remind him to wish for certain things by saying, '(Wish for) 
          so-and-so.' When there is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say, 
          'This is for you, and its equal (is for you) as well."
        <p> 'Ata' bin Yazid added: Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri who was present with Abu 
          Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira 
          said that Allah had said, "That is for you and its equal as well," Abu
          Sa'id Al-Khudri said, "And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!" Abu 
          Huraira said, "I do not remember, except his saying, 'That is for you 
          and its equal as well.'" Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri then said, "I testify 
          that I remember the Prophet saying, 'That is for you, and ten times as
          much.' ' Abu Huraira then added, "That man will be the last person of 
          the people of Paradise to enter Paradise."

        <p> Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri:
        <p> We said, "O Allah's Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of 
          Resurrection?" He said, "Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun 
          and the moon when the sky is clear?" We said, "No." He said, "So you 
          will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no
          difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky)." The 
          Prophet then said, "Somebody will then announce, 'Let every nation 
          follow what they used to worship.' So the companions of the cross will
          go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and
          the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, 
          till there remain those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient 
          ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the 
          Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage.
          Then it will be said to the Jews, "What did you use to worship?' They 
          will reply, 'We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.' It will be 
          said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. 
          What do you want (now)?' They will reply, 'We want You to provide us 
          with water.' Then it will be said to them 'Drink,' and they will fall 
          down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, 'What 
          did you use to worship?' 
        <p> They will reply, 'We used to worship Messiah, the son of Allah.' It 
          will be said, 'You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. 
          What: do you want (now)?' They will say, 'We want You to provide us 
          with water.' It will be said to them, 'Drink,' and they will fall down
          in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who used to worship 
          Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it 
          will be said to them, 'What keeps you here when all the people have 
          gone?' They will say, 'We parted with them (in the world) when we were
          in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one 
          proclaiming, 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship,' and 
          now we are waiting for our Lord.' Then the Almighty will come to them 
          in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He 
          will say, 'I am your Lord,' and they will say, 'You are not our Lord.'
          And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be
          said to them, 'Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?' 
          They will say. 'The Shin,' and so Allah will then uncover His Shin 
          whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will 
          remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and
          for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but 
          their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not 
          be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell." We, 
          the companions of the Prophet said, "O Allah's Apostle! What is the 
          bridge?'
        <p> He said, "It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and 
          (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the 
          other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in 
          Najd and is called As-Sa'dan. Some of the believers will cross the 
          bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as 
          lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be 
          safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some 
          scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person 
          will cross by being dragged (over the bridge)." The Prophet said, "You
          (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has
          been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with
          Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see 
          themselves safe. 
        <p> They will say, 'O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray 
          with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.' Allah will say,
          'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal 
          to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.' Allah will forbid the Fire to burn
          the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them
          in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their 
          legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then 
          they will return, and Allah will say (to them), 'Go and take out (of 
          Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one 
          half Dinar.' They will take out whomever they will recognize and 
          return, and then Allah will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in 
          whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a 
          smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will 
          recognize." Abu Sa'id said: If you do not believe me then read the 
          Holy Verse:--
        <p> 'Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest
          ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.' (4.40) The 
          Prophet added, "Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will 
          intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, 'Now 
          remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of the Fire from 
          which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and 
          they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called 
          the water of life. 
        <p> They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. 
          You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how 
          the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the 
          shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like
          pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will 
          enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, 'These are 
          the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into 
          Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending 
          forth any good (for themselves).' Then it will be said to them, 'For 
          you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.'"

        <p> Narrated Anas:
        <p> The Prophet said, "The believers will be kept (waiting) on the Day of 
          Resurrection so long that they will become worried and say, "Let us 
          ask somebody to intercede far us with our Lord so that He may relieve 
          us from our place. 
        <p> Then they will go to Adam and say, 'You are Adam, the father of the 
          people. Allah created you with His Own Hand and made you reside in His
          Paradise and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught 
          you the names of all things will you intercede for us with your Lord 
          so that He may relieve us from this place of ours? Adam will say, 'I 
          am not fit for this undertaking.' He will mention his mistakes he had 
          committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden 
          to do so. He will add, 'Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Allah to
          the people of the Earth.' The people will go to Noah who will say, 'I 
          am not fit for this undertaking' He will mention his mistake which he 
          had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.' He will say 
          (to them), 'Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.' They will go to Abraham 
          who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking. He would mention 
          three words by which he told a lie, and say (to them). 'Go to Moses, a
          slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and brought 
          near Him, for conversation.' 
        <p> They will go to Moses who will say, 'I am not fit for this 
          undertaking. He will mention his mistake he made, i.e., killing a 
          person, and will say (to them), 'Go to Jesus, Allah's slave and His 
          Apostle, and a soul created by Him and His Word.' (Be: And it was.) 
          They will go to Jesus who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking
          but you'd better go to Muhammad the slave whose past and future sins 
          have been forgiven by Allah.' So they will come to me, and I will ask 
          my Lord's permission to enter His House and then I will be permitted. 
          When I see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will
          leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will say, 'O
          Muhammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, 
          and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for 
          anything) for it will be granted:' Then I will raise my head and

          will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) I 
          will take them out and make them enter Paradise." (Qatada said: I 
          heard Anas saying that), the Prophet said, "I will go out and take 
          them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and then I will 
          return and ask my Lord for permission to enter His House and I will be
          permitted.

          state), and then He will say, 'O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, 
          for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will
          be accepted, and ask, your request will be granted.' " The Prophet 
          added, "So I will raise my head and glorify and praise Him as He has 
          taught me. Then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to 
          intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let 
          them enter Paradise." (Qatada added: I heard Anas saying that) the 
          Prophet said, 'I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let 
          them enter Paradise, and I will return for the third time and will ask
          my Lord for permission to enter His house, and I will be allowed to 
          enter. 
        <p> When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration before Him, and will 
          remain in prostration as long as He will, and then He will say, 'Raise
          your head, O Muhammad, and speak, for you will be listened to, and 
          intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, for your 
          request will be granted.' So I will raise my head and praise Allah as 
          He has taught me and then I will intercede and He will put a limit for
          me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out 
          and let them enter Paradise." (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that)

          and let them enter Paradise, till none will remain in the Fire except 
          those whom Quran will imprison (i.e., those who are destined for 
          eternal life in the fire)." The narrator then recited the Verse:-- "It
          may be that your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and 
          Glory.'    (17.79) The narrator added: This is the Station of Praise 
          and Glory which Allah has promised to your Prophet.

          to him and asked, 'Do you know Someone who is more learned than you

          Moses:--
        <p> 'Yes, Our Slave Khadir is more learned than you' Moses asked Allah how
          to meet him ( Khadir) So Allah made the fish as a sign for him and it 
          was said to him, 'When you lose the fish, go back (to the place where 
          you lose it) and you will meet him.' So Moses went on looking for the 
          sign of the fish in the sea. The boy servant of Moses (who was 
          accompanying him) said to him, 'Do you remember (what happened) when 
          we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget to tell you 
          (about) the fish. None but Satan made me forget to tell you about it'

        <p> We, i.e., some people from Basra gathered and went to Anas bin Malik, 
          and we went in company with Thabit Al-Bunnani so that he might ask him
          about the Hadith of Intercession on our behalf. Behold, Anas was in 
          his palace, and our arrival coincided with his Duha prayer. We asked 
          permission to enter and he admitted us while he was sitting on his 
          bed. We said to Thabit, "Do not ask him about anything else first but

          brethren from Basra coming to ask you about the Hadith of 
          Intercession." Anas then said, "Muhammad talked to us saying, 'On the 
          Day of Resurrection the people will surge with each other like waves, 
          and then they will come to Adam and say, 'Please intercede for us with
          your Lord.' He will say, 'I am not fit for that but you'd better go to

          Abraham and he will say, 'I am not fit for that, but you'd better go

          go to Moses and he will say, 'I am not fit for that, but you'd better 
          go to Jesus as he is a soul created by Allah and His Word.' (Be: And

        <p> They would come to me and I would say, 'I am for that.' Then I will

          inspire me to praise Him with such praises as I do not know now. So I 
          will praise Him with those praises and will fall down, prostrate 
          before Him. Then it will be said, 'O Muhammad, raise your head and 
          speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for your will be granted 
          (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be

          faith in their hearts, equal to the weight of a barley grain.' I will 
          go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall

          him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us." So we went to him and
          we greeted him and he admitted us. We said to him, "O Abu Said! We 
          came to you from your brother Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a 
          Hadith about the intercession the like of which I have never heard." 
          He said, "What is that?" Then we told him of the Hadith and said, "He 
          stopped at this point (of the Hadith)." He said, "What then?" We said,
          "He did not add anything to that." He said, Anas related the Hadith to
          me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don't know whether 
          he forgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might 
          have said." We said, "O Abu Said ! Let us know that." He smiled and 
          said, "Man was created hasty. I did not mention that, but that I 
          wanted to inform you of it. 
        <p> Anas told me the same as he told you and said that the Prophet added, 
          'I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and 
          prostrate before Him me the same as he 'O Muhammad, raise your head

        <p> The night Allah's Apostle was taken for a journey from the sacred 
          mosque (of Mecca) Al-Ka'ba: Three persons came to him (in a dreamy 
          while he was sleeping in the Sacred Mosque before the Divine 
          Inspiration was revealed to Him. One of them said, "Which of them is 
          he?" The middle (second) angel said, "He is the best of them." The 
          last (third) angle said, "Take the best of them." Only that much 
          happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on 
          another night, i.e. after The Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. 
          (Fateh-Al-Bari Page 258, Vol. 17) and he saw them, his eyes were 
          asleep but his heart was not----and so is the case with the prophets: 
          their eyes sleep while their hearts do not sleep. So those angels did 
          not talk to him till they carried him and placed him beside the well 
          of Zam-Zam. From among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut 
          open (the part of his body) between his throat and the middle of his 
          chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and abdomen 
          and then washed it with Zam-Zam water with his own hands till he 
          cleansed the inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a 
          gold bowl full of belief and wisdom was brought and then Gabriel 
          stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then closed it 
          (the chest). He then ascended with him to the heaven of the world and 
          knocked on one of its doors. 
        <p> The dwellers of the Heaven asked, 'Who is it?' He said, "Gabriel." 
          They said, "Who is accompanying you?" He said, "Muhammad." They said, 
          "Has he been called?" He said, "Yes" They said, "He is welcomed." So 
          the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with his arrival, and they 
          did not know what Allah would do to the Prophet on earth unless Allah 
          informed them. The Prophet met Adam over the nearest Heaven. Gabriel 
          said to the Prophet, "He is your father; greet him." The Prophet 
          greeted him and Adam returned his greeting and said, "Welcome, O my 
          Son! O what a good son you are!" Behold, he saw two flowing rivers, 
          while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, "What are these two rivers,
          O Gabriel?" Gabriel said, "These are the sources of the Nile and the 
          Euphrates." 
        <p> Then Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw another 
          river at the bank of which there was a palace built of pearls and 
          emerald. He put his hand into the river and found its mud like musk 
          Adhfar. He asked, "What is this, O Gabriel?" Gabriel said, "This is 
          the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for you." Then Gabriel ascended 
          (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the same 
          questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., "Who is it?" Gabriel 
          replied, "Gabriel". They asked, "Who is accompanying you?" He said, 
          "Muhammad." They asked, "Has he been sent for?" He said, "Yes." Then 
          they said, "He is welcomed.'' Then he (Gabriel) ascended with the 
          Prophet to the third Heaven, and the angels said the same as the 
          angels of the first and the second Heavens had said. 
        <p> Then he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they said the same;
          and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they said the 
          same; and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven and they said 
          the same; then he ascended with him to the seventh Heaven and they 
          said the same. On each Heaven there were prophets whose names he had 
          mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on the second Heaven, Aaron on 
          the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don't remember, on the
          fifth Heaven, Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh 
          Heaven because of his privilege of talking to Allah directly. Moses 
          said (to Allah), "O Lord! I thought that none would be raised up above
          me." 
        <p> But Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance above that,
          the distance of which only Allah knows, till he reached the Lote Tree 
          (beyond which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the Lord of 
          Honor and Majesty approached and came closer till he (Gabriel) was 
          about two bow lengths or (even) nearer. (It is said that it was 
          Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate Al-Bari 
          Page 263, 264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Allah revealed to him 
          then, was: "Fifty prayers were enjoined on his followers in a day and 
          a night." 
        <p> Then the Prophet descended till he met Moses, and then Moses stopped 
          him and asked, "O Muhammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?" The
          Prophet replied," He enjoined upon me to perform fifty prayers in a 
          day and a night." Moses said, "Your followers cannot do that; Go back 
          so that your Lord may reduce it for you and for them." So the Prophet 
          turned to Gabriel as if he wanted to consult him about that issue. 
          Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, "Yes, if you wish." So 
          Gabriel ascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in
          his place, "O Lord, please lighten our burden as my followers cannot 
          do that." So Allah deducted for him ten prayers where upon he returned
          to Moses who stopped him again and kept on sending him back to his 
          Lord till the enjoined prayers were reduced to only five prayers. 
        <p> Then Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to five and 
          said, "O Muhammad! By Allah, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani 
          Israel to do less than this, but they could not do it and gave it up. 
          However, your followers are weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, 
          so return to your Lord so that He may lighten your burden." 
        <p> The Prophet turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel did not 
          disapprove of that. So he ascended with him for the fifth time. The 
          Prophet said, "O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, 
          hearing and constitution, so lighten our burden." On that the 
          Irresistible said, "O Muhammad!" the Prophet replied, "Labbaik and 
          Sa'daik." Allah said, "The Word that comes from Me does not change, so
          it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the Book." Allah 
          added, "Every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is fifty 
          (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to perform
          only five (in practice)." 
        <p> The Prophet returned to Moses who asked, "What have you done?" He 
          said, "He has lightened our burden: He has given us for every good 
          deed a tenfold reward." Moses said, "By Allah! I tried to make Bani 
          Israel observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your
          Lord that He may lighten your burden further." Allah's Apostle said, 
          "O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of returning too many times to my 
          Lord." On that Gabriel said, "Descend in Allah's Name." The Prophet 
          then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca).
