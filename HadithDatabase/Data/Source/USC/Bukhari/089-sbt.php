            narrating things which are neither in Allah's Book, nor has been 
            mentioned by Allah's Apostle . Such people are the ignorant among you.
            Beware of such vain desires that mislead those who have them. I have 
            heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'This matter (of the caliphate) will 
            remain with the Quraish, and none will rebel against them, but Allah

          <p> The Prophet sent an army unit (for some campaign) and appointed a man 
            from the Ansar as its commander and ordered them (the soldiers) to 
            obey him. (During the campaign) he became angry with them and said, 
            "Didn't the Prophet order you to obey me?" They said, "Yes." He said, 
            "I order you to collect wood and make a fire and then throw yourselves
            into it." So they collected wood and made a fire, but when they were 
            about to throw themselves into, it they started looking at each other,
            and some of them said, "We followed the Prophet to escape from the 
            fire. How should we enter it now?" So while they were in that state, 
            the fire extinguished and their commander's anger abated. The event 
            was mentioned to the Prophet and he said, "If they had entered it (the
            fire) they would never have come out of it, for obedience is required 
            only in what is good." (See Hadith No. 629. Vol. 5)

            could not find any witness and then sat down. Then I thought that I 
            should mention the case to Allah's Apostle I (and when I did so) a man
            from those who were sitting with him said, "The arms of the killed

            favor of his opponent in the court, in the opinion of some scholars, 
            the judge should not pass a judgment against him till the latter calls
            two witnesses to witness his confession. And some people of Iraq said,
            "A judge can pass a judgement according to what he hears or witnesses 
            (the litigant's confession) in the court itself, but if the confession
            takes place outside the court, he should not pass the judgment unless 
            two witnesses witness the confession." Some of them said, "A judge can
            pass a judgement depending on his knowledge of the case as he is 
            trust-worthy, and that a witness is Required just to reveal the truth.
            The judge's knowledge is more than the witness." Some said, "A judge 
            can judge according to his knowledge only in cases involving property,
            but in other cases he cannot." Al-Qasim said, "A judge ought not to 
            pass a judgment depending on his knowledge if other people do not know
            what he knows, although his knowledge is more than the witness of 
            somebody else because he might expose himself to suspicion by the 
            Muslims and cause the Muslims to have unreasonable doubt. "

            Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas, "The son of the slave girl of Zam'a is from me, 
            so take him into your custody." So in the year of Conquest of Mecca, 
            Sa'd took him and said. (This is) my brother's son whom my brother has
            asked me to take into my custody." 'Abd bin Zam'a got up before him 
            and said, (He is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my 
            father, and was born on my father's bed." So they both submitted their
            case before Allah's Apostle. Sa'd said, "O Allah's Apostle! This boy 
            is the son of my brother and he entrusted him to me." 'Abd bin Zam'a 
            said, "This boy is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my 
            father, and was born on the bed of my father." Allah's Apostle said, 
            "The boy is for you, O 'Abd bin Zam'a!" Then Allah's Apostle further 
            said, "The child is for the owner of the bed, and the stone is for the
            adulterer," He then said to Sauda bint Zam'a, "Veil (screen) yourself 
            before him," when he saw the child's resemblance to 'Utba. The boy did
            not see her again till he met Allah.

          <p> Abu Bakr sent for me owing to the large number of casualties in the 
            battle of Al-Yamama, while 'Umar was sitting with him. Abu Bakr said 
            (to me), 'Umar has come to my and said, 'A great number of Qaris of 
            the Holy Quran were killed on the day of the battle of Al-Yamama, and 
            I am afraid that the casualties among the Qaris of the Quran may 
            increase on other battle-fields whereby a large part of the Quran may 
            be lost. Therefore I consider it advisable that you (Abu Bakr) should 
            have the Qur'an collected.' I said, 'How dare I do something which 
            Allah's Apostle did not do?' 'Umar said, By Allah, it is something 
            beneficial.' 'Umar kept on pressing me for that till Allah opened my 
            chest for that for which He had opened the chest of 'Umar and I had in
            that matter, the same opinion as 'Umar had." Abu Bakr then said to me 
            (Zaid), "You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion 
            about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's 
            Apostle. So you should search for the fragmentary scripts of the Quran
            and collect it (in one Book)." Zaid further said: By Allah, if Abu 
            Bakr had ordered me to shift a mountain among the mountains from one 
            place to another it would not have been heavier for me than this 
            ordering me to collect the Qur'an. Then I said (to 'Umar and Abu 
            Bakr), "How can you do something which Allah's Apostle did not do?" 
            Abu Bakr said, "By Allah, it is something beneficial." Zaid added: So 
            he (Abu Bakr) kept on pressing me for that until Allah opened my chest
            for that for which He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and
            I had in that matter, the same opinion as theirs. 
          <p> So I started compiling the Quran by collecting it from the leafless 
            stalks of the date-palm tree and from the pieces of leather and hides 
            and from the stones, and from the chests of men (who had memorized the
            Quran). I found the last verses of Sirat-at-Tauba: ("Verily there has 
            come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves--' 
            (9.128-129) ) from Khuzaima or Abi Khuzaima and I added to it the rest
            of the Sura. The manuscripts of the Quran remained with Abu Bakr till 
            Allah took him unto Him. Then it remained with 'Umar till Allah took 
            him unto Him, and then with Hafsa bint 'Umar.

            Muhaiyisa went to the Jews and said, "By Allah, you have killed my 
            companion." The Jews said, "By Allah, we have not killed him." 
            Muhaiyisa then came back to his people and told them the story. He, 
            his elder brother Huwaiyisa and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl came (to the

            eldest of you speak." So Huwaiyisa spoke first and then Muhaiyisa. 
            Allah's Apostle said, "The Jews should either pay the blood money of 
            your (deceased) companion or be ready for war." After that Allah's 
            Apostle wrote a letter to the Jews in that respect, and they wrote 
            that they had not killed him. Then Allah's Apostle said to Huwaiyisa, 
            Muhaiyisa and 'Abdur-Rahman, "Can you take an oath by which you will 
            be entitled to take the blood money?" They said, "No." He said (to

            replied, "But the Jews are not Muslims." So Allah's Apostle gave them

            those she-camels were made to enter the house, one of them kicked me

          <p> Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:
          <p> The group of people whom 'Umar had selected as candidates for the 
            Caliphate gathered and consulted each other. Abdur-Rahman said to 
            them, "I am not going to compete with you in this matter, but if you 
            wish, I would select for you a caliph from among you." So all of them 
            agreed to let 'Abdur-Rahman decide the case. So when the candidates 
            placed the case in the hands of 'Abdur-Rahman, the people went towards
            him and nobody followed the rest of the group nor obeyed any after 
            him. So the people followed 'Abdur-Rahman and consulted him all those 
            nights till there came the night we gave the oath of allegiance to 
            'Uthman. Al-Miswar (bin Makhrama) added: 'Abdur-Rahman called on me 
            after a portion of the night had passed and knocked on my door till I 
            got up, and he said to me, "I see you have been sleeping! By Allah, 
            during the last three nights I have not slept enough. Go and call 
            Az-Zubair and Sa'd.' So I called them for him and he consulted them 
            and then called me saying, 'Call 'Ali for me." I called 'Ali and he 
            held a private talk with him till very late at night, and then 'Al, 
            got up to leave having had much hope (to be chosen as a Caliph) but 
            'Abdur-Rahman was afraid of something concerning 'Ali. 'Abdur-Rahman 
            then said to me, "Call 'Uthman for me." I called him and he kept on 
            speaking to him privately till the Mu'adhdhin put an end to their talk
            by announcing the Adhan for the Fajr prayer. When the people finished 
            their morning prayer and that (six men) group gathered near the 
            pulpit, 'Abdur-Rahman sent for all the Muhajirin (emigrants) and the 
            Ansar present there and sent for the army chief who had performed the 
            Hajj with 'Umar that year. When all of them had gathered, 
            'Abdur-Rahman said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah," 
            and added, "Now then, O 'Ali, I have looked at the people's tendencies
            and noticed that they do not consider anybody equal to 'Uthman, so you
            should not incur blame (by disagreeing)." Then 'Abdur-Rahman said (to 
            'Uthman), "I gave the oath of allegiance to you on condition that you 
            will follow Allah's Laws and the traditions of Allah's Apostle and the
            traditions of the two Caliphs after him." So 'Abdur-Rahman gave the 
            oath of allegiance to him, and so did the people including the 
            Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar and the chiefs of the army staff 
            and all the Muslims.
