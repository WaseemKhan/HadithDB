        <blockquote>
          <p> Narrated Malik bin Aus bin Al-Hadathan:
          <p> Once I set out to visit 'Umar (bin Al-Khattab). (While I was sitting 
            there with him his gate-keeper, Yarfa, came and said, "Uthman 
            AbdurRahman (bin 'Auf), Az-Zubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) are seeking
            permission (to meet you)." 'Umar said, "Yes. So he admitted them and 
            they entered, greeted, and sat down. After a short while Yarfa came 
            again and said to 'Umar 'Shall I admit 'Ali and 'Abbas?" 'Umar said, 
            "Yes." He admitted them and when they entered, they greeted and sat 
            down. 'Abbas said, "O Chief of the Believers! Judge between me and 
            this ('Ali)." The group, 'Uthman and his companions Sad, 'O Chief of 
            the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other." 
            'Umar said. Wait! I beseech you by Allah, by Whose permission both the
            Heaven and the Earth stand fast ! Do you know that Allah's Apostle 
            said. 'We (Apostles) do not bequeath anything to our heirs, but 
            whatever we leave is to be given in charity.' And by that Allah's 
            Apostles meant himself?" The group said, "He did say so." 'Umar then 
            turned towards 'All and 'Abbas and said. "I beseech you both by Allah,
            do you know that Allah's Apostle said that?" They said, 'Yes " 'Umar 
            said, "Now, let me talk to you about this matter. Allah favored His 
            Apostle with something of this property (war booty) which He did not 
            give to anybody else. And Allah said:-- 'And what Allah has bestowed 
            on His Apostle (as Fai Booty) from them for which you made no 
            expedition with either cavalry or camelry . . . Allah is Able to do 
            all things.' (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Allah's
            Apostle. But by Allah he neither withheld it from you, nor did he keep
            it for himself and deprive you of it, but he gave it all to you and 
            distributed it among you till only this remained out of it. And out of
            this property Allah's Apostle used to provide his family with their 
            yearly needs, and whatever remained, he would spend where Allah's 
            Property (the revenues of Zakat) used to be spent. Allah's Apostle 
            kept on acting like this throughout his lifetime. Now I beseech you by
            Allah, do you know that?" They said, "Yes." Then 'Umar said to 'Ali 
            and 'Abbas, "I beseech you by Allah, do you both know that?" They 
            said, "Yes." 'Umar added, "When Allah had taken His Apostle unto Him, 
            Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Apostle. So he took 
            charge of that property and did with it the same what Allah's Apostle 
            used to do, and both of you knew all about it then." Then 'Umar turned
            towards 'Ali and Abbas and said, "You both claim that Abu- Bakr was 
            so-and-so! But Allah knows that he was honest, sincere, pious and 
            right (in that matter). Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die, and i said,
            'I am the successor of Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr.' So I kept this 
            property in my possession for the first two years of my rule, and I 
            used to do the same with it as Allah's Apostle  and Abu Bakr used to 
            do. Later both of you ('Ali and 'Abbas) came to me with the same claim
            and the same problem. (O 'Abbas!) You came to me demanding your share 
            from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he ('Ali) came 
            to me demanding his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. 
            So I said to you, 'If you wish I will hand over this property to you, 
            on condition that you both promise me before Allah that you will 
            manage it in the same way as Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as 
            I have done since the beginning of my rule; otherwise you should not 
            speak to me about it.' So you both said, 'Hand over this property to 
            us on this condition.' And on this condition I handed it over to you. 
            I beseech you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on that condition?"
            The group said, "Yes." 'Umar then faced 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, "I 
            beseech you both by Allah, did I hand it over to you both on that 
            condition?" They both said, "Yes." 'Umar added, "Do you want me now to
            give a decision other than that? By Him with Whose permission (order) 
            both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any 
            decision other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are 
            unable to manage it (that property), then return it to me and I will 
            be sufficient for it on your behalf . "

            we had gone to bed. We wanted to get up (on his arrival) but he said, 
            'Stay where you are." Then he came and sat between me and her and I

            you to something better than what you have requested? When you go to 
            bed say 'Subhan Allah' thirty-three times, 'Alhamdulillah' thirty

          <p> My father died and left seven or nine girls and I married a matron. 
            Allah's Apostle said to me, "O Jabir! Have you married?" I said, 
            "Yes." He said, "A virgin or a matron?" I replied, "A matron." he 
            said, "Why not a virgin, so that you might play with her and she with 
            you, and you might amuse her and she amuse you." I said, " 'Abdullah

            Prophet . He said, "Where is the questioner." The man said, "I am
