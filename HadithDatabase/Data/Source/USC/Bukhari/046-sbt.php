      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> The Prophet said, "Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah will save all 
          the parts of his body from the (Hell) Fire as he has freed the 
          body-parts of the slave." Said bin Marjana said that he narrated that 
          Hadith to 'Ali bin Al-Husain and he freed his slave for whom 'Abdullah
          bin Ja'far had offered him ten thousand Dirhams or one-thousand 
          Dinars.

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Abu Dhar:
        <p> I asked the Prophet, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe 
          in Allah and to fight for His Cause." I then asked, "What is the best 
          kind of manumission (of slaves)?" He replied, "The manumission of the 
          most expensive slave and the most beloved by his master." I said, "If 
          I cannot afford to do that?" He said, "Help the weak or do good for a 
          person who cannot work for himself." I said, "If I cannot do that?" He
          said, "Refrain from harming others for this will be regarded as a 
          charitable deed for your own good."

        <p> The Prophet said, "Whoever manumits a slave owned by two masters, 
          should manumit him completely (not partially) if he is rich after 
          having its price evaluated."

        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:
        <p> Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever frees his share of a common slave and 
          he has sufficient money to free him completely, should let its price 
          be estimated by a just man and give his partners the price of their 
          shares and manumit the slave; otherwise (i.e. if he has not sufficient
          money) he manumits the slave partially."

        <p> Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever manumits his share of a slave, then it 
          is essential for him to get that slave manumitted' completely as long 
          as he has the money to do so. If he has not sufficient money to pay 
          the price of the other shares (after the price of the slave is 
          evaluated justly), the manumitted manumits the slave partially in 
          proportion to his share.

        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
        <p> The Prophet said, "He who manumits his share of a slave and has money 
          sufficient to free the remaining portion of that slave's price (justly
          estimated) then he should manumit him (by giving the rest of his price
          to the other co-owners)." Nafi' added, "Otherwise the slave is 
          partially free." Aiyub is not sure whether the last statement was said
          by Nafi' or it was a part of the Hadith.

        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
        <p> That he used to give his verdict regarding the male or female slaves 
          owned by more than one master, one of whom may manumit his share of 
          the slave. Ibn 'Umar used to say in such a case, "The manumitted 
          should manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money to pay 
          the rest of the price of that slave (which is to be justly estimated) 
          and the other share-holders are to take the price of their shares and 
          the slave is freed (released from slavery)." Ibn 'Umar narrated this 
          verdict from the Prophet.

          like you to witness that I have manumitted him." That happened at the 
          time when Abu Huraira recited (the following poetic verse):-- 'What a

          the land of Kufr (disbelief).

          Islam, the slave showed up while I was still with the Prophet who

        <p> Narrated Marwan and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:
        <p> When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the Prophet and 
          they requested him to return their properties and captives. The 
          Prophet stood up and said to them, "I have other people with me in 
          this matter (as you see) and the most beloved statement to me is the 
          true one; you may choose either the properties or the prisoners as I 
          have delayed their distribution." The Prophet had waited for them for 
          more than ten days since his arrival from Ta'if. So, when it became 
          evident to them that the Prophet was not going to return them except 
          one of the two, they said, "We choose our prisoners." The Prophet got 
          up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah as He deserved 
          and said, "Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with 
          repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, 
          whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, 
          and whoever of you likes to stick to his share till we recompense him 
          from the very first war booty which Allah will give us, then he can do
          so (i.e. give up the present captives)." The people unanimously said, 
          "We do that (return the captives) willingly." The Prophet said, "We do
          not know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back 
          and let your leaders forward us your decision." So, all the people 
          then went back and discussed the matter with their leaders who 
          returned and informed the Prophet that all the people had willingly 
          given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached 
          us about the captives of Hawazin. Narrated Anas that 'Abbas said to 
          the Prophet, "I paid for my ransom and Aqil's ransom."
