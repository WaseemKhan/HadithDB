        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin  Umar:
        <p> Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Allah's Apostle 
          and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it 
          during the 'Id and when the delegations visit you." Allah's Apostle 
          (p.b.u.h) replied, "This dress is for those who have no share (in the 
          Hereafter)." After a long period Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to  
          Umar a cloak of silk brocade.  Umar came to Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) 
          with the cloak and said, "O Allah's Apostle! You said that this dress 
          was for those who had no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent 
          me this cloak." Allah's Apostle said to him, "Sell it and fulfill your
          needs by it."

        <p> Narrated  Aisha:
        <p> Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were 
          singing beside me the songs of Buath (a story about the war between 
          the two tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam). 
          The Prophet (p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. 
          Then Abu Bakr came and spoke to me harshly saying, "Musical 
          instruments of Satan near the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?" Allah's Apostle 
          (p.b.u.h) turned his face towards him and said, "Leave them." When Abu
          Bakr became inattentive, I signalled to those girls to go out and they
          left. It was the day of 'Id, and the Black people were playing with 
          shields and spears; so either I requested the Prophet (p.b.u.h) or he 
          asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the 
          affirmative. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and 
          my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, "Carry on! O Bani 
          Arfida," till I got tired. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, "Are you 
          satisfied (Is that sufficient for you)?" I replied in the affirmative 
          and he told me to leave.

          and after returning from the prayer we slaughter our sacrifices (in

          they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, "Musical

          the 'Id day and Allah's Apostle said, "O Abu Bakr! There is an 'Id for

          day on which one has desire for meat," and he mentioned something 
          about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then 
          the same man added, "I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me 
          than the meat of two sheep." The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it
          as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only 
          for him or for others as well.

        <p> The Prophet delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day 
          of Nahr and said, "Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters 
          like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah. And 
          whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the 'Id prayer then he has not
          done the sacrifice." Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara' said, 
          "O Allah's Apostle! I have slaughtered my sheep before the 'Id prayer 
          and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic 
          drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be 
          slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took my food 
          before coming for the prayer." The Prophet said, "The sheep which you 
          have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk)." He (Abu Burda) said, 
          "O Allah's Apostle! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than
          two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? "The 
          Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it 
          will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else after you."

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri:
        <p> The Prophet used to proceed to the Musalla on the days of Id-ul-Fitr 
          and Id-ul-Adha; the first thing to begin with was the prayer and after
          that he would stand in front of the people and the people would keep 
          sitting in their rows. Then he would preach to them, advise them and 
          give them orders, (i.e. Khutba). And after that if he wished to send 
          an army for an expedition, he would do so; or if he wanted to give and
          order, he would do so, and then depart. The people followed this 
          tradition till I went out with Marwan, the Governor of Medina, for the
          prayer of Id-ul-Adha or Id-ul-Fitr.
        <p> When we reached the Musalla, there was a pulpit made by Kathir bin 
          As-Salt. Marwan wanted to get up on that pulpit before the prayer. I 
          got hold of his clothes but he pulled them and ascended the pulpit and
          delivered the Khutba before the prayer. I said to him, "By Allah, you 
          have changed (the Prophet's tradition)." He replied, "O Abu Sa'id! 
          Gone is that which you know." I said, "By Allah! What I know is better
          than what I do not know." Marwan said, "People do not sit to listen to
          our Khutba after the prayer, so I delivered the Khutba before the 
          prayer."

          said, "No doubt, it is incumbent upon the Imams to do so and why

          had said, "I join the Prophet, Abu Bakr,  Umar and 'Uthman in the 'Id 
          ul Fitr prayers. They used to offer the prayer before the Khutba and 
          then they used to deliver the Khutba afterwards. Once the Prophet I 
          came out (for the 'Id prayer) as if I were just observing him waving 
          to the people to sit down. He, then accompanied by Bilal, came 
          crossing the rows till he reached the women. He recited the following 
          verse: 'O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the 
          oath of fealty to you . . . (to the end of the verse) (60.12).' After 
          finishing the recitation he said, "O ladies! Are you fulfilling your 
          covenant?" None except one woman said, "Yes." Hasan did not know who 
          was that woman. The Prophet said, "Then give alms." Bilal spread his 
          garment and said, "Keep on giving alms. Let my father and mother 
          sacrifice their lives for you (ladies)." So the ladies kept on putting
          their Fatkhs (big rings) and other kinds of rings in Bilal's garment."
          Abdur-Razaq said, " 'Fatkhs' is a big ring which used to be worn in 
          the (Pre-lslamic) period of ignorance.
