          They said, "In how many Ghazwat did you join him?" He replied,

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud:
        <p> From Sad bin Mu'adh: Sad bin Mu'adh was an intimate friend of Umaiya 
          bin Khalaf and whenever Umaiya passed through Medina, he used to stay 
          with Sad, and whenever Sad went to Mecca, he used to stay with Umaiya.
          When Allah's Apostle arrived at Medina, Sa'd went to perform 'Umra and
          stayed at Umaiya's home in Mecca. He said to Umaiya, "Tell me of a 
          time when (the Mosque) is empty so that I may be able to perform Tawaf
          around the Ka'ba." So Umaiya went with him about midday. Abu Jahl met 
          them and said, "O Abu Safwan! Who is this man accompanying you?" He 
          said, "He is Sad." Abu Jahl addressed Sad saying, "I see you wandering
          about safely in Mecca inspite of the fact that you have given shelter 
          to the people who have changed their religion (i.e. became Muslims) 
          and have claimed that you will help them and support them. By Allah, 
          if you were not in the company of Abu Safwan, you would not be able to
          go your family safely." Sad, raising his voice, said to him, "By 
          Allah, if you should stop me from doing this (i.e. performing Tawaf) I
          would certainly prevent you from something which is more valuable for 
          you, that is, your passage through Medina." On this, Umaiya said to 
          him, "O Sad do not raise your voice before Abu-l-Hakam, the chief of 
          the people of the Valley (of Mecca)." Sad said, "O Umaiya, stop that! 
          By Allah, I have heard Allah's Apostle predicting that the Muslim will
          kill you." Umaiya asked, "In Mecca?" Sad said, "I do not know." Umaiya
          was greatly scared by that news. 
        <p> When Umaiya returned to his family, he said to his wife, "O Um Safwan!
          Don't you know what Sad told me? "She said, "What has he told you?" He
          replied, "He claims that Muhammad has informed them (i.e. companions 
          that they will kill me. I asked him, 'In Mecca?' He replied, 'I do not
          know." Then Umaiya added, "By Allah, I will never go out of Mecca." 
          But when the day of (the Ghazwa of) Badr came, Abu Jahl called the 
          people to war, saying, "Go and protect your caravan." But Umaiya 
          disliked to go out (of Mecca). Abu Jahl came to him and said, "O Abu 
          Safwan! If the people see you staying behind though you are the chief 
          of the people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you." 
          Abu Jahl kept on urging him to go until he (i.e. Umaiya) said, "As you
          have forced me to change my mind, by Allah, I will buy the best camel 
          in Mecca. Then Umaiya said (to his wife). "O Um Safwan, prepare what I
          need (for the journey)." She said to him, "O Abu Safwan! Have you 
          forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?" He said, "No, but I do
          not want to go with them but for a short distance." So when Umaiya 
          went out, he used to tie his camel wherever he camped. He kept on 
          doing that till Allah caused him to be killed at Badr.

          in the Ghazwa of Tabuk. However, I did not take part in the Ghazwa of 
          Badr, but none who failed to take part in it, was blamed, for Allah's 
          Apostle had gone out to meet the caravans of (Quraish, but Allah

          previous intention) .

        <p> I witnessed Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad in a scene which would have been 
          dearer to me than anything had I been the hero of that scene. He (i.e.
          Al-Miqdad) came to the Prophet while the Prophet was urging the 
          Muslims to fight with the pagans. Al-Miqdad said, "We will not say as 
          the People of Moses said: Go you and your Lord and fight you two. 
          (5.27). But we shall fight on your right and on your left and in front
          of you and behind you." I saw the face of the Prophet getting bright 
          with happiness, for that saying delighted him.

          to You (to fulfill) Your Covenant and Promise. O Allah! If Your Will 
          is that none should worship You (then give victory to the pagans)." 
          Then Abu Bakr took hold of him by the hand and said, "This is 
          sufficient for you." The Prophet came out saying, "Their multitude 
          will be put to flight and they will show their backs."   (54.45)

        <p> Allah's Apostle sent out ten spies under the command of 'Asim bin 
          Thabit Al-Ansari, the grand-father of 'Asim bin 'Umar Al-Khattab. When
          they reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between 'Usfan and Mecca, their
          presence was made known to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. 
          So they sent about one hundred archers after them. The archers traced 
          the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found the traces of dates 
          which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said,
          "These dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina)," and went on tracing the 
          Muslims' footsteps. When 'Asim and his companions became aware of 
          them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them
          and said, "Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise and 
          covenant that we will not kill anyone of you." 'Asim bin Thabit said, 
          "O people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the 
          protection of an infidel. O Allah! Inform your Prophet about us." So 
          the archers threw their arrows at them and martyred 'Asim. Three of 
          them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise and 
          covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. 
          When the archers got hold of them, they untied the strings of the 
          arrow bows and tied their captives with them. The third man said, 
          "This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not go with 
          you for I follow the example of these." He meant the martyred 
          companions. The archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they 
          martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by
          them and later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca after the event of
          the Badr battle.
        <p> The sons of Al-Harit bin 'Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for he was a 
          person who had killed (their father) Al-Hari bin 'Amr on the day (of

          lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of

          him on his thigh while the razor was in his hand. She was so much 
          terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said, "Are you afraid that
          I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing." Later on (while 
          narrating the story) she said, "By Allah, I had never seen a better 
          captive than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a bunch 
          of grapes in his hand while he was fettered with iron chains and (at 
          that time) there was no fruit in Mecca." She used to say," It was food
          Allah had provided Khubaib with." 
        <p> When they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to martyr him, 
          Khubaib requested them. "Allow me to offer a two-Rak'at prayer." They 
          allowed him and he prayed two Rakat and then said, "By Allah! Had I 
          not been afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have 
          prayed more." Then he (invoked evil upon them) saying, "O Allah! Count
          them and kill them one by one, and do not leave anyone of them"' Then 
          he recited: "As I am martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I
          receive my death for Allah's Sake, for this is for the Cause of Allah.
          If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body." Then Abu Sarva,
          'Ubqa bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who 
          set the tradition of praying for any Muslim to be martyred in 
          captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet told his companions of 
          what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were 
          martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of 'Asim bin Thabit's 
          death, sent some messengers to bring a part of his body so that his 
          death might be known for certain, for he had previously killed one of 
          their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a swarm of wasps
          to protect the dead body of 'Asim, and they shielded him from the 
          messengers who could not cut anything from his body.

        <p> I had a she-camel which I got in my share from the booty of the battle
          of Badr, and the Prophet had given me another she camel from the 
          Khumus which Allah had bestowed on him that day. And when I intended 
          to celebrate my marriage to Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet, I 
          made an arrangement with a goldsmith from Bani Qainuqa 'that he should
          go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass used by gold-smiths)
          which I intended to sell to gold-smiths in order to spend its price on
          the marriage banquet. While I was collecting ropes and sacks of pack 
          saddles for my two she-camels which were kneeling down beside an 
          Ansari's dwelling and after collecting what I needed,  I suddenly 
          found that the humps of the two she-camels had been cut off and their 
          flanks had been cut open and portions of their livers had been taken 
          out. On seeing that, I could not help weeping. I asked, "Who has done 
          that?" They (i.e. the people) said, "Hamza bin 'Abdul Muttalib has 
          done it. He is present in this house with some Ansari drinkers, a girl
          singer, and his friends. The singer said in her song, "O Hamza, get at
          the fat she-camels!" On hearing this, Hamza rushed to his sword and 
          cut of the camels' humps and cut their flanks open and took out 
          portions from their livers." Then I came to the Prophet, with whom 
          Zaid bin Haritha was present. The Prophet noticed my state and asked, 
          "What is the matter?" I said, "O Allah's Apostle, I have never 
          experienced such a day as today! Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut
          off their humps and cut their flanks open, and he is still present in 
          a house along some drinkers." The Prophet asked for his cloak, put it 
          on, and proceeded, followed by Zaid bin Haritha and myself, till he 
          reached the house where Hamza was. He asked the permission to enter, 
          and he was permitted. The Prophet started blaming Hamza for what he 
          had done. Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. He looked at the 
          Prophet then raised his eyes to look at his knees and raised his eves 
          more to look at his face and then said, "You are not but my father's 
          slaves." When the Prophet understood that Hamza was drunk, he 
          retreated, walking backwards went out and we left with him.

          me and this (i.e. 'Ali). "Both of them had a dispute regarding the 
          property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai 
          (i.e. booty gained without fighting), 'Ali and 'Abbas started

          companions) said, "O chief of the believers! Give your verdict in 
          their case and relieve each from) the other." 'Umar said, "Wait I 
          beseech you, by Allah, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the 
          earth stand fast! Do you know that Allah's Apostle said, 'We 
          (Prophets) our properties are not to be inherited, and whatever we 
          leave, is to be spent in charity,' and he said it about himself?" They
          (i.e. 'Uthman and his company) said, "He did say it. "'Umar then 
          turned towards 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, "I beseech you both, by 
          Allah! Do you know that Allah's Apostle said this?" They replied in 
          the affirmative. He said, "Now I am talking to you about this matter. 
          Allah the Glorified favored His Apostle with something of this Fai 
          (i.e. booty won without fighting) which He did not give to anybody 
          else. Allah said:--
        <p> "And what Allah gave to His Apostle ("Fai"" Booty) from them--For 
          which you made no expedition With either Calvary or camelry. But Allah
          gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will And Allah is able 
          to do all things." (59.6) 
        <p> So this property was especially granted to Allah's Apostle . But by 
          Allah, the Prophet neither took it all for himself only, nor deprived 
          you of it, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you
          till only this remained out of it. And from this Allah's Apostle used 
          to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and whatever used to 
          remain, he used to spend it where Allah's Property is spent (i.e. in 
          charity), Allah's Apostle kept on acting like that during all his 
          life, Then he died, and Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's 
          Apostle.' So he (i.e. Abu Bakr) took charge of this property and 
          disposed of it in the same manner as Allah's Apostle used to do, and 
          all of you (at that time) knew all about it." Then 'Umar turned 
          towards 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, "You both remember that Abu Bakr 
          disposed of it in the way you have described and Allah knows that, in 
          that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly guided and the follower of
          the right. Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die and I said, 'I am the 
          successor of Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr.' So I kept this property in
          my possession for the first two years of my rule (i.e. Caliphate and I
          used to dispose of it in the same wa as Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr 
          used to do; and Allah knows that I have been sincere, pious, rightly 
          guided an the follower of the right (in this matte Later on both of 
          you (i.e. 'Ali and Abbas) came to me, and the claim of you both was 
          one and the same, O 'Abbas! You also came to me. So I told you both 
          that Allah's Apostle said, "Our property is not inherited, but 
          whatever we leave is to be given in charity.' Then when I thought that
          I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition 
          that you will promise and pledge before Allah that you will dispose it
          off in the same way as Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have 
          done since the beginning of my caliphate or else you should not speak 
          to me (about it).' So, both of you said to me, 'Hand it over to us on 
          this condition.' And on this condition I handed it over to you. Do you
          want me now to give a decision other than that (decision)? By Allah, 
          with Whose Permission both the sky and the earth stand fast, I will 
          never give any decision other than that (decision) till the Last Hour 
          is established. But if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that 
          property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your behalf." 
          The sub-narrator said, "I told 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Hadith and 
          he said, 'Malik bin Aus has told the truth" I heard 'Aisha, the wife 
          of the Prophet saying, 'The wives of the Prophet sent 'Uthman to Abu 
          Bakr demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Allah had granted 
          to his Apostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you 
          not fear Allah? Don't you know that the Prophet used to say: Our 
          property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in 
          charity? The Prophet mentioned that regarding himself. He added: 'The 
          family of Muhammad can take their sustenance from this property. So 
          the wives of the Prophet stopped demanding it when I told them of 
          that.' So, this property (of Sadaqa) was in the hands of Ali who 
          withheld it from 'Abbas and overpowered him. Then it came in the hands
          of Hasan bin 'Ali, then in the hands of Husain bin 'Ali, and then in 
          the hands of Ali bin Husain and Hasan bin Hasan, and each of the last 
          two used to manage it in turn, then it came in the hands of Zaid bin 
          Hasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Allah's Apostle ."

          camel load of food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will 
          mortgage our arms to you." Muhammad bin Maslama and his companion 
          promised Kab that Muhammad would return to him. He came to Kab at 
          night along with Kab's foster brother, Abu Na'ila. Kab invited them to
          come into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him,
          "Where are you going at this time?" Kab replied, "None but Muhammad 
          bin Maslama and my (foster) brother Abu Na'ila have come." His wife 
          said, "I hear a voice as if dropping blood is from him, Ka'b said. 
          "They are none but my brother Muhammad bin Maslama and my foster 
          brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night 
          even if invited to be killed." Muhammad bin Maslama went with two men.
          (Some narrators mention the men as   'Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus 
          and Abbad bin Bishr). So Muhammad bin Maslama went in together with 
          two men, and sail to them, "When Ka'b comes, I will touch his hair and
          smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip 
          him. I will let you smell his head." Kab bin Al-Ashraf came down to 
          them wrapped in his clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad bin 
          Maslama said. " have never smelt a better scent than this. Ka'b 
          replied. "I have got the best 'Arab women who know how to use the high
          class of perfume." Muhammad bin Maslama requested Ka'b "Will you allow
          me to smell your head?" Ka'b said, "Yes." Muhammad smelt it and made 
          his companions smell it as well. Then he requested Ka'b again, "Will 
          you let me (smell your head)?" Ka'b said, "Yes." When Muhammad got a 
          strong hold of him, he said (to his companions), "Get at him!" So they
          killed him and went to the Prophet and informed him. (Abu Rafi) was 
          killed after Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf."

        <p> Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib:
        <p> Allah's Apostle sent some men from the Ansar to ((kill) Abu Rafi, the 
          Jew, and appointed 'Abdullah bin Atik as their leader. Abu Rafi used 
          to hurt Allah's Apostle and help his enemies against him. He lived in 
          his castle in the land of Hijaz. When those men approached (the 
          castle) after the sun had set and the people had brought back their 
          livestock to their homes. Abdullah (bin Atik) said to his companions, 
          "Sit down at your places. I am going, and I will try to play a trick 
          on the gate-keeper so that I may enter (the castle)." So 'Abdullah 
          proceeded towards the castle, and when he approached the gate, he 
          covered himself with his clothes, pretending to answer the call of 
          nature. The people had gone in, and the gate-keeper (considered 
          'Abdullah as one of the castle's servants) addressing him saying, "O 
          Allah's Servant! Enter if you wish, for I want to close the gate." 
          'Abdullah added in his story, "So I went in (the castle) and hid 
          myself. When the people got inside, the gate-keeper closed the gate 
          and hung the keys on a fixed wooden peg. I got up and took the keys 
          and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at night with Abu 
          Rafi for a pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions 
          of nightly entertainment went away, I ascended to him, and whenever I 
          opened a door, I closed it from inside. I said to myself, 'Should 
          these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me 
          till I have killed him.' So I reached him and found him sleeping in a 
          dark house amidst his family, I could not recognize his location in 
          the house. So I shouted, 'O Abu Rafi!' Abu Rafi said, 'Who is it?' I 
          proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with the sword, 
          and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He cried loudly, 
          and I came out of the house and waited for a while, and then went to 
          him again and said, 'What is this voice, O Abu Rafi?' He said, 'Woe to
          your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a sword! I again hit 
          him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the 
          sword into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his 
          back, and I realized that I have killed him. I then opened the doors 
          one by one till I reached the staircase, and thinking that I had 
          reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg broken 
          in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a turban and proceeded on till 
          I sat at the gate, and said, 'I will not go out tonight till I know 
          that I have killed him.' So, when (early in the morning) the cock 
          crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on the wall saying, 'I 
          announce the death of Abu Rafi, the merchant of Hijaz. Thereupon I 
          went to my companions and said, 'Let us save ourselves, for Allah has 
          killed Abu Rafi,' So I (along with my companions proceeded and) went 
          to the Prophet and described the whole story to him. "He said, 
          'Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it 
          and it became All right as if I had never had any ailment 
          whatsoever."

        <p> Narrated Al-Bara:
        <p> Allah's Apostle sent 'Abdullah bin 'Atik and 'Abdullah bin 'Utba with 
          a group of men to Abu Rafi (to kill him). They proceeded till they 
          approached his castle, whereupon 'Abdullah bin Atik said to them, 
          "Wait (here), and in the meantime I will go and see." 'Abdullah said 
          later on, "I played a trick in order to enter the castle. By chance, 
          they lost a donkey of theirs and came out carrying a flaming light to 
          search for it. I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered
          my head and legs and pretended to answer the call to nature. The 
          gatekeeper called, 'Whoever wants to come in, should come in before I 
          close the gate.' So I went in and hid myself in a stall of a donkey 
          near the gate of the castle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi and 
          had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to their homes. 
          When the voices vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came
          out. I had seen where the gate-keeper had kept the key of the castle 
          in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked the gate of the castle, 
          saying to myself, 'If these people should notice me, I will run away 
          easily.' Then I locked all the doors of their houses from outside 
          while they were inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi by a staircase. I saw
          the house in complete darkness with its light off, and I could not 
          know where the man was. So I called, 'O Abu Rafi!' He replied, 'Who is
          it?' I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He cried loudly but my
          blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying 
          with a different tone of my voice, ' What is wrong with you, O Abu 
          Rafi?' He said, 'Are you not surprised? Woe on your mother! A man has 
          come to me and hit me with a sword!' So again I aimed at him and hit 
          him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi cried 
          loudly and his wife got up. I came again and changed my voice as if I 
          were a helper, and found Abu Rafi lying straight on his back, so I 
          drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the sound 
          of a bone break. Then I came out, filled with astonishment and went to
          the staircase to descend, but I fell down from it and got my leg 
          dislocated. I bandaged it and went to my companions limping. I said 
          (to them), 'Go and tell Allah's Apostle of this good news, but I will 
          not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu Rafi's) 
          death.' When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and 
          announced, 'I convey to you the news of Abu Rafi's death.' I got up 
          and proceeded without feeling any pain till I caught up with my 
          companions before they reached the Prophet to whom I conveyed the good
          news."

        <p> Narrated Al-Bara:
        <p> We faced the pagans on that day (of the battle of Uhud) and the 
          Prophet placed a batch of archers (at a special place) and appointed 
          'Abdullah (bin Jubair) as their commander and said, "Do not leave this
          place; and if you should see us conquering the enemy, do not leave 
          this place, and if you should see them conquering us, do not (come to)
          help us," So, when we faced the enemy, they took to their heel till I 
          saw their women running towards the mountain, lifting up their clothes
          from their legs, revealing their leg-bangles. The Muslims started 
          saying, "The booty, the booty!" 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, "The 
          Prophet had taken a firm promise from me not to leave this place." But
          his companions refused (to stay). So when they refused (to stay 
          there), (Allah) confused them so that they could not know where to go,
          and they suffered seventy casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place
          and said, "Is Muhammad present amongst the people?" The Prophet said, 
          "Do not answer him." Abu Sufyan said, "Is the son of Abu Quhafa 
          present among the people?" The Prophet said, "Do not answer him." Abd 
          Sufyan said, "Is the son of Al-Khattab amongst the people?" He then 
          added, "All these people have been killed, for, were they alive, they 
          would have replied." On that, 'Umar could not help saying, "You are a 
          liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept what will make you unhappy." 
          Abu Safyan said, "Superior may be Hubal!" On that the Prophet said (to
          his companions), "Reply to him." They asked, "What may we say?" He 
          said, "Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!" Abu Sufyan 
          said, "We have (the idol) Al-'Uzza, whereas you have no 'Uzza!" The 
          Prophet said (to his companions), "Reply to him." They said, "What may
          we say?" The Prophet said, "Say: Allah is our Helper and you have no 
          helper." Abu Sufyan said, "(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr
          and (in) the battle (the victory) is always undecided and shared in 
          turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead men

          (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have

          (fleeing), and asked him, "Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a 
          smell of Paradise before Uhud." Then he proceeded on and was martyred.

          round the biggest heap of dates thrice, and then sat over it and said,
          'O Jabir), call your companions (i.e. the creditors).' Then he kept on
          measuring (and giving) to the creditors (their due) till Allah paid 
          all the debt of my father. I would have been satisfied to retain 
          nothing of those dates for my sisters after Allah had paid the debts 
          of my father. But Allah saved all the heaps (of dates), so that when I
          looked at the heap where the Prophet had been sitting, it seemed as if
          a single date had not been taken away thereof."

          like to see Wahshi so that we may ask him about the killing of Hamza?"

          'Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except his
          eyes and feet. 'Ubaidullah said, "O Wahshi! Do you know me?" Wahshi 
          looked at him and then said, "No, by Allah! But I know that 'Adi bin 
          Al-Khiyar married a woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is,

          then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child's 
          feet." Then 'Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), "Will
          you tell us (the story of) the killing of Hamza?" Wahshi replied "Yes,
          Hamza killed Tuaima bin 'Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr (battle) so my 
          master, Jubair bin Mut'im said to me, 'If you kill Hamza in revenge

          (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of 'Ainain ..'Ainain is a 
          mountain near the mountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a
          valley.. I went out with the people for the battle. When the army 
          aligned for the fight, Siba' came out and said, 'Is there any (Muslim)
          to accept my challenge to a duel?' Hamza bin 'Abdul Muttalib came out 
          and said, 'O Siba'. O Ibn Um Anmar, the one who circumcises other 
          ladies! Do you challenge Allah and His Apostle?' Then Hamza attacked 
          and killed him, causing him to be non-extant like the bygone 
          yesterday. I hid myself under a rock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came 
          near me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus so 
          that it came out through his buttocks, causing him to die. When all 
          the people returned to Mecca, I too returned with them. I stayed in 
          (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, 
          and when the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Allah's 
          Apostle, I was told that the Prophet did not harm the messengers; So I
          too went out with them till I reached Allah's Apostle. When he saw me,
          he said, 'Are you Wahshi?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Was it you who 
          killed Hamza?' I replied, 'What happened is what you have been told 
          of.' He said, 'Can you hide your face from me?' So I went out when 
          Allah's Apostle died, and Musailamah Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to
          be a prophet). I said, 'I will go out to Musailamah so that I may kill

          (to fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events took 
          place concerning that battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) 
          standing near a gap in a wall. He looked like an ash-colored camel and
          his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him, driving it into

          shoulders, and then an Ansari man attacked him and struck him on the 
          head with a sword. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, 'A slave girl on the roof

        <p> Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah
        <p> Allah's Apostle used to shroud two martyrs of Uhud in one sheet and 
          then say, "Which of them knew Quran more?" When one of the two was 
          pointed out, he would put him first in the grave. Then he said, "I 
          will be a witness for them on the Day of Resurrection." He ordered 
          them to be buried with their blood (on their bodies). Neither was the 
          funeral prayer offered for them, nor were they washed. Jabir added, 
          "When my father was martyred, I started weeping and uncovering his 
          face. The companions of the Prophet stopped me from doing so but the 
          Prophet did not stop me. Then the Prophet said, '(O Jabir.) don't weep
          over him, for the angels kept on covering him with their wings till 
          his body was carried away (for burial)."

        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> The Prophet sent a Sariya of spies and appointed 'Asim bin Thabit, the
          grandfather of 'Asim bin 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, as their leader. So 
          they set out, and when they reached (a place) between 'Usfan and 
          Mecca, they were mentioned to one of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail
          called Lihyan. So, about one-hundred archers followed their traces 
          till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station where they 
          (i.e. 'Asim and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates
          they had brought as journey food from Medina. 
        <p> The archers said, "These are the dates of Medina," and followed their 
          traces till they took them over. When 'Asim and his companions were 
          not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their pursuers 
          encircled them and said, "You have a covenant and a promise that if 
          you come down to us, we will not kill anyone of you." 'Asim said, "As 
          for me, I will never come down on the security of an infidel. O Allah!
          Inform Your Prophet about us." So they fought with them till they 
          killed 'Asim along with seven of his companions with arrows, and there
          remained Khubaib, Zaid and another man to whom they gave a promise and
          a covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, 
          they came down. When they captured them, they opened the strings of 
          their arrow bows and tied them with it. The third man who was with 
          them said, "This is the first breach in the covenant," and refused to 
          accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them,
          but he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking 
          Khubaib and Zaid till they sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith 
          bin 'Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was Khubaib who had killed 
          Al-Harith bin 'Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for a 
          while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that
          time) Khubaib borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al-Harith 
          to shave his pubic hair. She gave it to him. She said later on, "I was
          heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved towards Khubaib, and when
          it reached him, he put it on his thigh. 
        <p> When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my distress 
          while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said 'Are you afraid 
          that I will kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,' " Later on 
          she used to say, "I have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once
          I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes although at that time no 
          fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron chains, 
          and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah." So 
          they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, 
          "Allow me to offer a two-Rak'at prayer." Then he went to them and 
          said, "Had I not been afraid that you would think I was afraid of 
          death, I would have prayed for a longer time." So it was Khubaib who 
          first set the tradition of praying two Rakat before being executed. He
          then said, "O Allah! Count them one by one," and added, 'When I am 
          being martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my 
          death for Allah's Sake, because this death is in Allah's Cause. If He 
          wishes, He will bless the cut limbs." Then 'Uqba bin Al-Harith got up 
          and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish (infidels) sent some
          people to 'Asim in order to bring a part of his body so that his death
          might be known for certain, for 'Asim had killed one of their chiefs 
          on the day of Badr. But Allah sent a cloud of wasps which protected 
          his body from their messengers who could not harm his body 
          consequently.

          of seventy riders. The chief of the pagans, 'Amir bin At-Tufail 
          proposed three suggestions (to the Prophet ) saying, "Choose one of 
          three alternatives: (1) that the bedouins will be under your command 
          and the townspeople will be under my command; (2) or that I will be 
          your successor, (3) or otherwise I will attack you with two thousand

          of Um so-and-so. He said, "Shall I stay in the house of a lady from 
          the family of so-and-so after having a (swelled) gland like that 
          she-camel? Get me my horse." So he died on the back of his horse. Then
          Haram, the brother of Um Sulaim and a lame man along with another man 
          from so-and-so (tribe) went towards the pagans (i.e. the tribe of 
          'Amir). Haram said (to his companions), "Stay near to me, for I will 
          go to them. If they (i.e. infidels) should give me protection, you 
          will be near to me, and if they should kill me, then you should go

          give me protection so as to convey the message of Allah's Apostle ?" 
          So, he started talking to them' but they signalled to a man (to kill

          pointing at a killed person, asked Amr, "Who is this?" 'Amr bin Umaiya
          said to him, "He is 'Amir bin Fuhaira." 'Amir bin At-Tufail said, "I 
          saw him lifted to the sky after he was killed till I saw the sky 
          between him and the earth, and then he was brought down upon the 
          earth. Then the news of the killed Muslims reached the Prophet and he 
          announced the news of their death saying, "Your companions (of Bir 
          Ma'una) have been killed, and they have asked their Lord saying, 'O 
          our Lord! Inform our brothers about us as we are pleased with You and 
          You are pleased with us." So Allah informed them (i.e. the Prophet and
          his companions) about them (i.e. martyrs of Bir Mauna).
        <p> On that day, 'Urwa bin Asma bin As-Salt who was one of them, was

        <p> We were digging (the trench) on the day of (Al-Khandaq ( i.e. Trench

          coming down." Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we
          had not eaten anything for three days. So the Prophet took the spade 
          and struck the big solid rock and it became like sand. I said, "O 
          Allah's Apostle! Allow me to go home." (When the Prophet allowed me) I
          said to my wife, "I saw the Prophet in a state that I cannot treat 
          lightly. Have you got something (for him to eat?" She replied, "I have
          barley and a she goat." So I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground 
          the barley; then we put the meat in the earthenware cooking pot. Then 
          I came to the Prophet when the dough had become soft and fermented and
          (the meat in) the pot over the stone trivet had nearly been 
          well-cooked, and said, "I have got a little food prepared, so get up O
          Allah's Apostle, you and one or two men along with you (for the 
          food)." The Prophet asked, "How much is that food?" I told him about 
          it. He said, "It is abundant and good. Tell your wife not to remove 
          the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out any bread from 
          the oven till I reach there." Then he said (to all his companions), 
          "Get up." So the Muhajirn (i.e. Emigrants) and the Ansar got up. When 
          I came to my wife, I said, "Allah's Mercy be upon you! The Prophet 
          came along with the Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who were present
          with them." She said, "Did the Prophet ask you (how much food you 
          had)?" I replied, "Yes." Then the Prophet said, "Enter and do not 
          throng." The Prophet started cutting the bread (into pieces) and put 
          the cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven 
          whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his 
          companions and take the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the 
          bread and scooping the meat (for his companions) till they all ate 
          their fill, and even then, some food remained. Then the Prophet said 
          (to my wife), "Eat and present to others as the people are struck with

          (to my house) and Allah's Apostle too, came, proceeding before the

          you and keep on taking out scoops from your earthenware meat-pot, and

          took their meals), and by Allah they all ate, and when they left the 
          food and went away, our earthenware pot was still bubbling (full of

          to the people their date palms). My people ordered me to ask the 
          Prophet to return some or all the date palms they had given to him, 
          but the Prophet had given those trees to Um Aiman. On that, Um Aiman 
          came and put the garment around my neck and said, "No, by Him except 
          Whom none has the right to be worshipped, he will not return those 
          trees to you as he (i.e. the Prophet ) has given them to me." The

          much (instead of them)." But she kept on refusing, saying, "No, by 
          Allah," till he gave her ten times the number of her date palms.

        <p> Sad was wounded on the day of Khandaq (i.e. Trench) when a man from 
          Quraish, called Hibban bin Al-'Araqa hit him (with an arrow). The man 
          was Hibban bin Qais from (the tribe of) Bani Mais bin 'Amir bin Lu'ai 
          who shot an arrow at Sad's medial arm vein (or main artery of the 
          arm). The Prophet pitched a tent (for Sad) in the Mosque so that he 
          might be near to the Prophet to visit. When the Prophet returned from 
          the (battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and laid down his arms and 
          took a bath Gabriel came to him while he (i.e. Gabriel) was shaking 
          the dust off his head, and said, "You have laid down the arms?" By 
          Allah, I have not laid them down. Go out to them (to attack them)." 
          The Prophet said, "Where?" Gabriel pointed towards Bani Quraiza. So 
          Allah's Apostle went to them (i.e. Banu Quraiza) (i.e. besieged them).
          They then surrendered to the Prophet's judgment but he directed them 
          to Sad to give his verdict concerning them. Sad said, "I give my 
          judgment that their warriors should be killed, their women and 
          children should be taken as captives, and their properties 
          distributed."
        <p> Narrated Hisham: My father informed me that 'Aisha said, "Sad said, "O
          Allah! You know that there is nothing more beloved to me than to fight
          in Your Cause against those who disbelieved Your Apostle and turned 
          him out (of Mecca). O Allah! I think you have put to an end the fight 
          between us and them (i.e. Quraish infidels). And if there still 
          remains any fight with the Quraish (infidels), then keep me alive till
          I fight against them for Your Sake. But if you have brought the war to
          an end, then let this wound burst and cause my death thereby.' So 
          blood gushed from the wound. There was a tent in the Mosque belonging 
          to Banu Ghifar who were surprised by the blood flowing towards them . 
          They said, 'O people of the tent! What is this thing which is coming 
          to us from your side?' Behold! Blood was flowing profusely out of 
          Sad's wound. Sad then died because of that."

          one on whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the 
          Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with 
          Allah's Apostle after Allah's order of veiling (the women) had been 
          revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and 
          carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on
          till Allah's Apostle had finished from that Ghazwa of his and 
          returned. 
        <p> When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it 
          was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, 
          I got up and went away from the army camps, and after finishing from 
          the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my 
          chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. 
          Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I 
          returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In
          the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and 
          took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to 
          ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were 
          light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover 
          their bodies in abundance as they used to eat only a little food. 
          Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while 
          lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. 
          They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found
          my necklace after the army had gone. 
        <p> Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor 
          one who would respond to the call. So I intended to go to the place 
          where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back 
          to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was 
          overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami 
          Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the 
          morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me 
          on seeing me as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling 
          (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited Istirja' (i.e. "Inna 
          lillahi wa inna llaihi raji'un") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled
          my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a 
          single word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his 
          Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting
          his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he 
          set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the 
          army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a
          rest). (Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon 
          themselves and the one who spread the Ifk (i.e. slander) more, was 
          'Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul."
        <p> (Urwa said, "The people propagated the slander and talked about it in 
          his (i.e. 'Abdullah's) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it
          and asked about it to let it prevail." Urwa also added, "None was 
          mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides ('Abdullah) 
          except Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh 
          along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but they were a

          Apostle would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and 
          leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. 
          slander) till I went out after my convalescence, I went out with Um 
          Mistah to Al-Manasi' where we used to answer the call of nature and we
          used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and
          that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our
          concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old

          call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot entangled in 
          her covering sheet and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I 
          said, 'What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took 
          part in the battle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you Hantah! Didn't 
          you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? 'I said, 'What did he say?'
        <p> Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was 
          aggravated, and when I reached my home, Allah's Apostle came to me, 
          and after greeting me, said, 'How is that (lady)?' I said, 'Will you 
          allow me to go to my parents?' as I wanted to be sure about the news 
          through them. Allah's Apostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) 
          and asked my mother, 'O mother! What are the people talking about?' 
          She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry, for scarcely is there a 
          charming woman who is loved by her husband and whose husband has other
          wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would find faults with 
          her.' I said, 'Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are 
          the people really talking in this way?' I kept on weeping that night 
          till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning 
          again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed. 
        <p> Allah's Apostle called 'Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask 
          and consult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew 
          of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me. Usama
          said, '(O Allah's Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not know 
          anything except good about her.' 'Ali bin Abi Talib said, 'O Allah's 
          Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there are plenty of 
          women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the 
          truth.' On that Allah's Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) 
          and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see anything which aroused your 
          suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the 
          Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would 
          conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough 
          of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' 
        <p> So, on that day, Allah's Apostle got up on the pulpit and complained 
          about 'Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, 'O
          you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with 
          his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except 
          good about my family and they have blamed a man about whom I know 
          nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with 
          me.' Sad bin Mu'adh the brother of Banu 'Abd Al-Ashhal got up and 
          said, 'O Allah's Apostle! I will relieve you from him; if he is from 
          the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from 
          our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your
          order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, 
          was from his branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of 
          Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for
          his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu'adh). 'By Allah, you 
          have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to 
          your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' 
        <p> On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin Mu'adh) got 
          up and said to Sad bin 'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will 
          surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of 
          hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so 
          much excited that they were about to fight while Allah's Apostle was 
          standing on the pulpit. Allah's Apostle kept on quietening them till 
          they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with 
          my tears never ceasing, and I could never sleep.
        <p> In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a
          day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought
          that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were 
          sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant 
          her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and when she came in, she 
          sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, 
          Allah's Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with 
          me since that day of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine 
          Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah's Apostle then recited 
          Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O 'Aisha! I have been informed 
          so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal 
          your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah 
          and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and 
          asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.'
        <p> When Allah's Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing 
          completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said
          to my father, 'Reply to Allah's Apostle on my behalf concerning what 
          he has said.' My father said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to 
          Allah's Apostle .' Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Apostle
          on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Allah, I do 
          not know what to say to Allah's Apostle.' In spite of the fact that I 
          was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Quran, I said, 'By 
          Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that
          it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it 
          as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe
          me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am 
          innocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude 
          for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) 
          patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is 
          Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other 
          side and lay on my bed; and Allah knew then that I was innocent and 
          hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence. But, by Allah, I never 
          thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, 
          that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to
          be talked of by Allah with something of my concern, but I hoped that 
          Allah's Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my 
          innocence. But, by Allah, before Allah's Apostle left his seat and 
          before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to 
          Allah's Apostle.
        <p> So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake 
          him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping 
          from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day and that was 
          because of the weighty statement which was being revealed to him. When
          that state of Allah's Apostle was over, he got up smiling, and the 
          first word he said was, 'O 'Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!'
          Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's 
          Apostle). I replied, 'By Allah, I will not go to him, and I praise 
          none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:-- "Verily! They who 
          spread the slander Are a gang, among you............." (24.11-20) 
        <p> Allah revealed those Quranic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu Bakr 
          As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of
          his relationship to him and his poverty, said, 'By Allah, I will never
          give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after what he has said about 
          Aisha.' Then Allah revealed:--
        <p> "And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not to 
          give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who
          have left their homes for Allah's cause, let them pardon and forgive. 
          Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is 
          oft-Forgiving Most Merciful." (24.22) 
        <p> Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah 
          forgive me.' and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give him 
          before. He also added, 'By Allah, I will never deprive him of it at 
          all.'
        <p> Aisha further said:." Allah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh 
          (i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, 'What do you know 
          and what did you see?" She replied, "O Allah's Apostle! I refrain from
          claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know 
          nothing except good (about 'Aisha).' From amongst the wives of the 
          Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the love she received 
          from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her 
          piety. Her sister Hamna, started struggling on her behalf and she was 
          destroyed along with those who were destroyed. The man who was blamed 
          said, 'Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never 
          uncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.' Later on the man was 
          martyred in Allah's Cause."

        <p> The people used to say that Ibn 'Umar had embraced Islam before 'Umar.
          This is not true. What happened is that 'Umar sent 'Abdullah to bring 
          his horse from an Ansari man so as to fight on it. At that time the 
          people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to Allah's Apostle near 
          the Tree, and 'Umar was not aware of that. So Abdullah (bin Umar) gave
          the Pledge of Allegiance (to the Prophet) and went to take the horse 
          and brought it to 'Umar. While 'Umar was putting on the armor to get 
          ready for fighting, 'Abdullah informed him that the people were giving
          the Pledge of allegiance to Allah's Apostle beneath the Tree. So 'Umar
          set out and 'Abdullah accompanied him till he gave the Pledge of 
          allegiance to Allah's Apostle, and it was this event that made people 
          say that Ibn 'Umar had embraced Islam before 'Umar. "Abdullah bin 
          'Umar added, "The people were along with the Prophet on the day of 
          Al-Hudaibiya spreading in the shade of the trees. Suddenly the people 
          surrounded the Prophet and started looking at him." 'Umar said, "O 
          'Abdullah! Go and see why the people are encircling Allah's Apostle 
          and looking at him." 'Abdullah bin Umar then saw the people giving the
          Pledge o allegiance to the Prophet. So he also gave the Pledge of 
          allegiance and returned to 'Umar who went out in his turn and gave the
          Pledge of allegiance to the Prophet.'

          Won't you let us hear your poetry?" 'Amir was a poet, so he got down

          been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In charity, 
          nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed
          (i.e. our defects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And

          refuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others' help 
          Against us." The Prophet on that, asked, "Who is that (camel) driver 
          (reciting poetry)?" The people said, "He is 'Amir bin Al-Akwa'." 
        <p> Then the Prophet said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on him." A man 
          amongst the people said, "O Allah's Prophet! has (martyrdom) been 
          granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company longer." Then 
          we reached and besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe 
          hunger. Then Allah helped the Muslims conquer it (i.e. Khaibar). In 
          the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the Muslims made 
          huge fires. The Prophet said, "What are these fires? For cooking what,
          are you making the fire?" The people replied, "(For cooking) meat." He
          asked, "What kind of meat?" They (i.e. people) said, "The meat of 
          donkeys." The Prophet said, "Throw away the meat and break the pots!" 
          Some man said, "O Allah's Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and 
          wash the pots instead?" He said, "(Yes, you can do) that too." So when
          the army files were arranged in rows (for the clash), 'Amir's sword 
          was short and he aimed at the leg of a Jew to strike it, but the sharp
          blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own knee, and that 
          caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Allah's Apostle
          saw me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, "What is bothering 
          you?" I replied, "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The 
          people say that the deeds of 'Amir are lost." The Prophet said, 
          "Whoever says so, is mistaken, for 'Amir has got a double reward." The
          Prophet raised two fingers and added, "He (i.e. Amir) was a 
          persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and there are few 'Arabs

        <p> During one of his Ghazawat, the Prophet encountered the pagans, and 
          the two armies fought, and then each of them returned to their army 
          camps. Amongst the (army of the) Muslims there was a man who would 
          follow every pagan separated from the army and strike him with his 
          sword. It was said, "O Allah's Apostle! None has fought so 
          satisfactorily as so-and-so (namely, that brave Muslim). "The Prophet 
          said, "He is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire." The people said,

          people said, "I will follow him and accompany him in his fast and slow
          movements." The (brave) man got wounded, and wanting to die at once, 
          he put the handle of his sword on the ground and its tip in between 
          his breasts, and then threw himself over it, committing suicide. Then 
          the man (who had watched the deceased) returned to the Prophet and 
          said, "I testify that you are Apostle of Allah." The Prophet said, 
          "What is this?" The man told him the whole story. The Prophet said, "A
          man may do what may seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of
          Paradise, but he is of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire and a man may do

          him. We were (three) I and my two brothers. I was the youngest of 
          them, and one of the two was Abu Burda, and the other, Abu Ruhm, and 
          our total number was either 53 or 52 men from my people. We got on 
          board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in Ethiopia. There we met 
          Ja'far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina)

          with Allah's Apostle who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and 
          advised the ignorant ones amongst you, we were in the far-off hated

          (to Asma'), "What did you say to him?" Asma's aid, "I told him 
          so-and-so." The Prophet said, "He (i.e. 'Umar) has not got more right 
          than you people over me, as he and his companions have (the reward of)
          only one migration, and you, the people of the boat, have (the reward

          other people of the boat coming to me in successive groups, asking me 
          about this narration,, and to them nothing in the world was more

        <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
        <p> Fatima the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr (when he 
          was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah's Apostle had 
          left of the property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty
          gained without fighting) in Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of 
          the Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr said, "Allah's 
          Apostle said, "Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave, is 
          Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this 
          property.' By Allah, I will not make any change in the state of the 
          Sadaqa of Allah's Apostle and will leave it as it was during the 
          lifetime of Allah's Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allah's Apostle
          used to do." So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. 
          So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not 
          task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the
          death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband 'Ali, buried her at 
          night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by 
          himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect 'Ali much, 
          but after her death, 'Ali noticed a change in the people's attitude 
          towards him. So Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him 
          an oath of allegiance. 'Ali had not given the oath of allegiance 
          during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and 
          Fatima's death). 'Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, "Come to us, 
          but let nobody come with you," as he disliked that 'Umar should come, 
          'Umar said (to Abu Bakr), "No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them
          alone " Abu Bakr said, "What do you think they will do to me? By 
          Allah, I will go to them' So Abu Bakr entered upon them, and then 'Ali
          uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), "We know well your 
          superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of 
          the good what Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us 
          in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in
          it because of our near relationship to Allah's Apostle ." 
        <p> Thereupon Abu Bakr's eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr spoke, 
          he said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with 
          the relatives of Allah's Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good 
          relations with my own relatives. But as for the trouble which arose 
          between me and you about his property, I will do my best to spend it 
          according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or regulation 
          which I saw Allah's Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will 
          follow." On that 'Ali said to Abu Bakr, "I promise to give you the 
          oath of allegiance in this after noon." So when Abu Bakr had offered 
          the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and
          then mentioned the story of 'Ali and his failure to give the oath of 
          allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had offered; 
          Then 'Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered 
          Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakr's right, and said, that he had not done 
          what he had done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of 
          that Allah had favored him with. 'Ali added, "But we used to consider 
          that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and that he 
          (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore 
          caused us to feel sorry." On that all the Muslims became happy and 
          said, "You have done the right thing." The Muslims then became 
          friendly with 'Ali as he returned to what the people had done (i.e. 
          giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr).

        <p> When the Prophet went out for the 'Umra in the month of Dhal-Qa'da, 
          the people of Mecca did not allow him to enter Mecca till he agreed to
          conclude a peace treaty with them by virtue of which he would stay in 
          Mecca for three days only (in the following year). When the agreement 
          was being written, the Muslims wrote: "This is the peace treaty, which
          Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has concluded."
        <p> The infidels said (to the Prophet), "We do not agree with you on this,
          for if we knew that you are Apostle of Allah we would not have 
          prevented you for anything (i.e. entering Mecca, etc.), but you are 
          Muhammad, the son of 'Abdullah." Then he said to 'Ali, "Erase (the 
          name of) 'Apostle of Allah'." 'Ali said, "No, by Allah, I will never 
          erase you (i.e. your name)." Then Allah's Apostle took the writing 
          sheet...and he did not know a better writing..and he wrote or got it 
          the following written! "This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, the 
          son of 'Abdullah, has concluded: "Muhammad should not bring arms into 
          Mecca except sheathed swords, and should not take with him any person 
          of the people of Mecca even if such a person wanted to follow him, and
          if any of his companions wants to stay in Mecca, he should not forbid 
          him."
        <p> (In the next year) when the Prophet entered Mecca and the allowed 
          period of stay elapsed, the infidels came to Ali and said "Tell your 
          companion (Muhammad) to go out, as the allowed period of his stay has 
          finished." So the Prophet departed (from Mecca) and the daughter of 
          Hamza followed him shouting "O Uncle, O Uncle!" Ali took her by the 
          hand and said to Fatima, "Take the daughter of your uncle." So she 
          made her ride (on her horse). (When they reached Medina) 'Ali, Zaid 
          and Ja'far quarreled about her. 'Ali said, "I took her for she is the 
          daughter of my uncle." Ja'far said, "She is the daughter of my uncle 
          and her aunt is my wife." Zaid said, "She is the daughter of my 
          brother." On that, the Prophet gave her to her aunt and said, "The 
          aunt is of the same status as the mother." He then said to 'Ali, "You 
          are from me, and I am from you," and said to Ja'far, "You resemble me 
          in appearance and character," and said to Zaid, "You are our brother 
          and our freed slave." 'Ali said to the Prophet 'Won't you marry the 
          daughter of Hamza?" The Prophet said, "She is the daughter of my 
          foster brother."

          Balta'a to some pagans of Mecca, telling them about what Allah's 
          Apostle intended to do. Allah's Apostle said, "O Hatib! What is this?"

          me. I was a person not belonging to Quraish but I was an ally to them 
          from outside and had no blood relation with them, and all the

          protect their families and properties. So I liked to do them a favor

          with them. I did not do this to renegade from my religion (i.e. Islam)
          nor did I do it to choose Heathenism after Islam." Allah's Apostle 
          said to his companions." As regards him, he (i.e. Hatib) has told you 
          the truth." 'Umar said, "O Allah's Apostle! Allow me to chop off the

          perhaps Allah looked at those who witnessed Badr and said, "O the

          Abu Sufyan, Hakim bin Hizam and Budail bin Warqa came out to gather 
          information about Allah's Apostle , They proceeded on their way till 
          they reached a place called Marr-az-Zahran (which is near Mecca). 
          Behold! There they saw many fires as if they were the fires of Arafat.

          of the guards of Allah's Apostle saw them and took them over, caught 
          them and brought them to Allah's Apostle. Abu Sufyan embraced Islam.

          Muslims. So Al-'Abbas kept him standing (at that place) and the tribes

          be permissible." Abu Sufyan said., "O 'Abbas! How excellent the day of

          day to show them something about me (i.e. my knowledge). 'Umar asked

          and the Conquest (of Mecca) And you see mankind entering the Religion 
          of Allah (i.e. Islam) in crowds. 'So celebrate the Praises Of your

          similarly?" I said, "No." 'Umar said "What do you say then?" I said, 
          "This Verse indicates the approaching of the death of Allah's Apostle

          it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the 'Arabs (other than 
          Quraish) delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of 
          Mecca). They used to say." "Leave him (i.e. Muhammad) and his people 
          Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a true Prophet. So, when 
          Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and my 
          father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my

          one of you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the

        <p> Narrated Abu Qatada:
        <p> We set out along with the Prophet during the year of (the battle of) 
          Hunain, and when we faced the enemy, the Muslims (with the exception 
          of the Prophet and some of his companions) retreated (before the 
          enemy). I saw one of the pagans over-powering one of the Muslims, so I
          struck the pagan from behind his neck causing his armor to be cut off.
          The pagan headed towards me and pressed me so forcibly that I felt as 
          if I was dying. Then death took him over and he released me. 
          Afterwards I followed 'Umar and said to him, "What is wrong with the 
          people?" He said, "It is the Order of Allah." Then the Muslims 
          returned (to the battle after the flight) and (after overcoming the 
          enemy) the Prophet sat and said, "Whoever had killed an Infidel and 
          has an evidence to this issue, will have the Salb (i.e. the belonging 
          of the deceased e.g. clothes, arms, horse, etc)." I (stood up) and 
          said, "Who will be my witness?" and then sat down. Then the Prophet 
          repeated his question. Then the Prophet said the same (for the third 
          time). I got up and said, "Who will be my witness?" and then sat down.
          The Prophet asked his former question again. So I got up. The Prophet 
          said, What is the matter, O Abu Qatada?" So I narrated the whole 
          story; A man said, "Abu Qatada has spoken the truth, and the Salb of 
          the deceased is with me, so please compensate Abu Qatada on my 
          behalf." Abu Bakr said, "No! By Allah, it will never happen that the 
          Prophet will leave a Lion of Allah who fights for the Sake of Allah 
          and His Apostle and give his spoils to you." The Prophet said, "Abu 
          Bakr has spoken the truth. Give it (the spoils) back to him (O man)!" 
          So he gave it to me and I bought a garden in (the land of) Banu Salama
          with it (i.e. the spoils) and that was the first property I got after 
          embracing Islam.

        <p> Narrated Abu Qatada:
        <p> When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, I saw a Muslim man 
          fighting with one of the pagans and another pagan was hiding himself 
          behind the Muslim in order to kill him. So I hurried towards the pagan
          who was hiding behind the Muslim to kill him, and he raised his hand 
          to hit me but I hit his hand and cut it off. That man got hold of me 
          and pressed me so hard that I was afraid (that I would die), then he 
          knelt down and his grip became loose and I pushed him and killed him. 
          The Muslims (excepting the Prophet and some of his companions) started
          fleeing and I too, fled with them. Suddenly I met 'Umar bin Al-Khattab
          amongst the people and I asked him, "What is wrong with the people?" 
          He said, "It is the order of Allah" Then the people returned to 
          Allah's Apostle (after defeating the enemy). Allah's Apostle said, 
          "Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the
          spoils of the killed man." So I got up to look for an evidence to 
          prove that I had killed an infidel, but I could not find anyone to 
          bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came to my mind (that I 
          should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Allah's Apostle. A man
          from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, 
          "The arms of the deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada) has 
          mentioned, are with me, so please compensate him for it (i.e. the 
          spoils)," Abu Bakr said, "No, Allah's Apostle will not give it (i.e. 
          the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of 
          Allah's Lions who fights on behalf of Allah and His Apostle." Allah's 
          Apostle then got up and gave that (spoils) to me, and I bought with 
          it, a garden which was the first property I got after embracing 
          Islam.

          Amir at the head of an army to Autas He (i.e. Abu Amir) met Duraid bin
          As Summa and Duraid was killed and Allah defeated his companions. The 
          Prophet sent me with Abu 'Amir. Abu Amir was shot at his knee with an 
          arrow which a man from Jushm had shot and fixed into his knee. I went 
          to him and said, "O Uncle! Who shot you?" He pointed me out (his 
          killer) saying, "That is my killer who shot me (with an arrow)." So I 
          headed towards him and overtook him, and when he saw me, he fled, and 
          I followed him and started saying to him, "Won't you be ashamed? Won't
          you stop?" So that person stopped, and we exchanged two hits with the 
          swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu 'Amir. "Allah has killed 
          your killer." He said, "Take out this arrow" So I removed it, and 
          water oozed out of the wound. He then said, "O son of my brother! 
          Convey my compliments to the Prophet and request him to ask Allah's 
          Forgiveness for me." Abu Amir made me his successor in commanding the 
          people (i.e. troops). He survived for a short while and then died. 
          (Later) I returned and entered upon the Prophet at his house, and 
          found him lying in a bed made of stalks of date-palm leaves knitted 
          with ropes, and on it there was bedding. The strings of the bed had 
          their traces over his back and sides. Then I told the Prophet about 
          our and Abu Amir's news and how he had said "Tell him to ask for 
          Allah's Forgiveness for me." The Prophet asked for water, performed 
          ablution and then raised hands, saying, "O Allah's Forgive 'Ubaid, Abu
          Amir." At that time I saw the whiteness of the Prophet's armpits. The 
          Prophet then said, "O Allah, make him (i.e. Abu Amir) on the Day of 
          Resurrection, superior to many of Your human creatures." I said, "Will
          you ask Allah's Forgiveness for me?" (On that) the Prophet said, "O 
          Allah, forgive the sins of 'Abdullah bin Qais and admit him to a nice 
          entrance (i.e. paradise) on the Day of Resurrection." Abu Burda said,

          and said, "What is this news reaching me from you, O the group of 
          Ansar?" They kept silent, He added," O the group of Ansar! Won't you 
          be happy that the people take the worldly things and you take Allah's 
          Apostle to your homes reserving him for yourself?" They said, "Yes."

          and the Ansar took their way through a mountain pass, surely, I would 
          take the Ansar's mountain pass." Hisham said, "O Abu Hamza (i.e.

          first one, we would throw the first one and take the latter, but if we
          could not get a stone then we would collect some earth (i.e. soil) and
          then bring a sheep and milk that sheep over it, and perform the Tawaf 
          around it. When the month of Rajab came, we used (to stop the military

        <p> We were informed that Musailima Al-Kadhdhab had arrived in Medina and 
          stayed in the house of the daughter of Al-Harith. The daughter of 
          Al-Harith bin Kuraiz was his wife and she was the mother of 'Abdullah 
          bin 'Amir. There came to him Allah's Apostle accompanied by Thabit bin
          Qais bin Shammas who was called the orator of Allah's Apostle. Allah's
          Apostle had a stick in his hand then. The Prophet stopped before 
          Musailima and spoke to him. Musailima said to him, "If you wish, we 
          would not interfere between you and the rule, on condition that the 
          rule will be ours after you... The Prophet said, "If you asked me for 
          this stick, I would not give it to you. I think you are the same 
          person who was shown to me in a dream. And this is Thabit bin Al-Qais 
          who will answer you on my behalf." The Prophet then went away. I asked
          Ibn Abbas about the dream Allah's Apostle had mentioned. Ibn Abbas 
          said, "Someone told me that the Prophet said, "When I was sleeping, I

          frightened me and made me dislike them. Then I was allowed to blow on

          while Usama was riding behind him on (his she-camel)'. Al-Qaswa.' 
          Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talha were accompanying him. When he made his 
          she-camel kneel down near the Ka'ba, he said to 'Uthman, "Get us the 
          key (of the Ka'ba). He brought the key to him and opened the gate (of 
          the Ka'ba), for him. The Prophet, Usama, Bilal and 'Uthman (bin Talha)
          entered the Ka'ba and then closed the gate behind them (from inside). 
          The Prophet stayed there for a long period and then came out. The 
          people rushed to get in, but I went in before them and found Bilal 
          standing behind the gate, and I said to him, "Where did the Prophet 
          pray?" He said, "He prayed between those two front pillars." The Ka'ba
          was built on six pillars, arranged in two rows, and he prayed between 
          the two pillars of the front row leaving the gate of the Ka'ba at his 
          back and facing (in prayer) the wall which faces one when one enters 
          the Ka'ba. Between him and that wall (was the distance of about three 
          cubits). But I forgot to ask Bilal about the number of Rakat the 
          Prophet had prayed. There was a red piece of marble at the place where
          he (i.e. the Prophet) had offered the prayer.

          together and also these two camels tied together,"' referring to six 
          camels he had brought them from Sad at that time. The Prophet added, 
          "Take them to your companions and say, 'Allah (or Allah's Apostle ) 
          allows you to ride on these,' so ride on them." So I took those camels
          to them and said, "The Prophet allows you to ride on these (camels)

          somebody who heard the statement of Allah's Apostle. Do not think that

        <p> Who, from among Kab's sons, was the guide of Kab when he became blind:
          I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in 
          which he failed to take part. Kab said, "I did not remain behind 
          Allah's Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of 
          Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did 
          not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, 
          Allah's Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till 
          Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any 
          appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-'Aqaba (pledge) with Allah's 
          Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the
          Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the 
          people than it (i.e. Al-'Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle
          of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I 
          remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa. 
        <p> By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the 
          time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah's Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa,
          he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different 
          Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah's 
          Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the
          great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly
          (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. 
          So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. 
          Allah's Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could
          not be listed in a book namely, a register." Ka'b added, "Any man who 
          intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden 
          unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah's Apostle
          fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the 
          shade looked pleasant. Allah's Apostle and his companions prepared for
          the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along 
          with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to 
          myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept on delaying it every now and then 
          till the people got ready and Allah's Apostle and the Muslims along 
          with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, 
          and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days 
          after him, and then join them.' In the morning following their 
          departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done 
          nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but 
          returned without doing anything. 
        <p> Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was 
          missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I 
          wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure
          of Allah's Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people 
          (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none 
          around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom 
          Allah had excused. Allah's Apostle did not remember me till he reached
          Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, 
          'What did Ka'b do?' A man from Banu Salama said, 'O Allah's Apostle! 
          He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking 
          at his own flanks with pride.' Then Mu'adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad
          thing you have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about
          him but good.' Allah's Apostle kept silent." Ka'b bin Malik added, 
          "When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to 
          Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false 
          excuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?' And I
          took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it 
          was said that Allah's Apostle, had come near all the evil false 
          excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come
          out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided 
          firmly to speak the truth. So Allah's Apostle arrived in the morning, 
          and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque 
          first of all and offer a two-Rak'at prayer therein and then sit for 
          the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had 
          failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false)
          excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty 
          men; Allah's Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took 
          their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah's Forgiveness for them, and
          left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to 
          him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and 
          then said, 'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He said
          to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an 
          animal For carrying you?' I answered, "Yes, O Allah's Apostle! But by 
          Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of 
          the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an 
          excuse. 
        <p> By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and
          eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie 
          to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the 
          near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry 
          because of it, I hope for Allah's Forgiveness. Really, by Allah, there
          was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or wealthier
          than I was when I remained behind you.' Then Allah's Apostle said, 'As
          regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah 
          decides your case.' I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me 
          and said to me. 'By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before
          this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah's Apostle as the 
          others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah's 
          Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.' 
          By Allah, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return 
          (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to
          them, 'Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?' 
          They replied, 'Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as 
          you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to 
          you.' I said, 'Who are they?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri
          and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two 
          pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom 
          there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they 
          mentioned them to me. Allah's Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk 
          to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained 
          behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they 
          changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) 
          appeared strange to me as if I did not know it.
        <p> We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two 
          fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was 
          the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and 
          witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the 
          markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Allah's 
          Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the 
          prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in 
          return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to 
          him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he 
          would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he 
          would turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the 
          people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of 
          Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered 
          my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said,
          'O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah 
          and His Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by 
          Allah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of 
          Allah. He said, "Allah and His Apostle know it better.' Thereupon my 
          eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall." Ka'b 
          added, "While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a 
          Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to 
          sell his grains in Medina, saying, 'Who will lead me to Kab bin 
          Malik?' The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me 
          and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following
          was written:
        <p> "To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet )
          has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a 
          place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and 
          we will console you."
        <p> When I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a test.' 
          Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning 
          it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to
          me the messenger of Allah's Apostle and said, 'Allah's Apostle orders 
          you to keep away from your wife,' I said, 'Should I divorce her; or 
          else! what should I do?' He said, 'No, only keep aloof from her and do
          not cohabit her.' The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows.
          Then I said to my wife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till 
          Allah gives His Verdict in this matter." Kab added, "The wife of Hilal
          bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Hilal bin 
          Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do 
          you dislike that I should serve him? ' He said, 'No (you can serve 
          him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no 
          desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his 
          case began till this day of his.' 
        <p> On that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask 
          Allah's Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted
          the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By Allah, I will 
          not ask the permission of Allah's Apostle regarding her, for I do not 
          know What Allah's Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to 
          serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I remained in that state for 
          ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was 
          completed starting from the time when Allah's Apostle prohibited the 
          people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the 
          50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting 
          in the condition which Allah described (in the Quran) i.e. my very 
          soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me 
          for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had 
          ascended the mountain of Sala' calling with his loudest voice, 'O Kab 
          bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down in 
          prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah's 
          Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah when 
          he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to 
          congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two 
          fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam 
          came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than 
          the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me 
          conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him 
          with them; and by Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that 
          day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah's 
          Apostle.
        <p> The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on 
          Allah's Acceptance of my repentance, saying, 'We congratulate you on 
          Allah's Acceptance of your repentance." Kab further said, "When I 
          entered the Mosque. I saw Allah's Apostle sitting with the people 
          around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with 
          me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. 
          Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never 
          forget this for Talha." Kab added, "When I greeted Allah's Apostle he,
          his face being bright with joy, said "Be happy with the best day that 
          you have got ever since your mother delivered you." Kab added, "I said
          to the Prophet 'Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He said, 
          'No, it is from Allah.' Whenever Allah's Apostle became happy, his 
          face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that 
          characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Allah's 
          Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all
          my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah's 
          Apostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for 
          you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,' and 
          added, 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; 
          so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as 
          I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah 
          has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned 
          that truth to Allah's Apostle till today, I have never intended to 
          tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from telling lies) 
          the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:--
        <p> "Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants
          (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed)."
          (9.117-119) 
        <p> By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me 
          to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie 
          to Allah's Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who 
          have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with
          the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else. Allah 
          said:-- "They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you when 
          you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased 
          with the rebellious people--" (9.95-96) Kab added, "We, the three 
          persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah's Apostle 
          accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance 
          and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah's Apostle left our case 
          pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah 
          said):--  And to the three (He did for give also) who remained 
          behind." (9.118)
        <p> What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take 
          part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a 
          decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of 
          those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by 
          accepting their excuses.

          Apostle became worse (on Thursday) and he said, fetch me something so 
          that I may write to you something after which you will never go 
          astray." The people (present there) differed in this matter, and it 
          was not right to differ before a prophet. Some said, "What is wrong 
          with him ? (Do you think ) he is delirious (seriously ill)?  Ask him (
          to understand his state )." So they went to the Prophet and asked him 
          again. The Prophet said, "Leave me, for my present state is better 
          than what you call me for." Then he ordered them to do three things. 
          He said, "Turn the pagans out of the 'Arabian Peninsula; respect and 
          give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen me dealing with
          them." (Said bin Jubair, the sub-narrator said that Ibn Abbas kept

          something after which you will not go astray.' Some of them ( i.e. his

          you will not go astray.' while the others said the other way round. So
          when their talk and differences increased, Allah's Apostle said, "Get

          great disaster) that Allah's Apostle was prevented from writing for 
          them that writing because of their differences and noise."

          I saw the Prophet, while I was supporting him against my chest. He 
          asked for a tray, and then fell on one side and expired, and I did not
          feel it. So how (do the people say) he appointed 'Ali as his 
          successor?"

        <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
        <p> When the Prophet was healthy, he used to say, "No soul of a prophet is
          captured till he is shown his place in Paradise and then he is given 
          the option."  When death approached him while his head was on my 
          thigh, he became unconscious and then recovered his consciousness. He 
          then looked at the ceiling of the house and said, "O Allah! (with) the
          highest companions." I said (to myself), "Hence, he is not going to 
          choose us." Then I realized that what he had said was the application 
          of the narration which he used to mention to us when he was healthy. 
          The last word he spoke was, "O Allah! (with) the highest companion."
