        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira;
        <p> Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the bowing in the 
          last Raka he used to say: "O Allah! Save 'Aiyash bin Abi Rabi'a. O 
          Allah! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah! Save Walid bin Walid. O Allah!
          Save the weak faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribes of 
          Mudar and send (famine) years on them like the famine years of 
          (Prophet) Joseph ." The Prophet further said, "Allah forgive the 
          tribes of Ghifar and save the tribes of Aslam." Abu Az-Zinad (a 
          sub-narrator) said, "The Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in 
          the Fajr prayer."

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Masruq:
        <p> We were with 'Abdullah and he said, "When the Prophet saw the refusal 
          of the people to accept Islam he said, "O Allah! Send (famine) years 
          on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the 
          time) of (Prophet) Joseph." So famine overtook them for one year and 
          destroyed every kind of life to such an extent that the people started
          eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals. Whenever one of them 
          looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke 
          because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, "O 
          Muhammad! You order people to obey Allah and to keep good relations 
          with kith and kin. No doubt the people of your tribe are dying, so 
          please pray to Allah for them." So Allah revealed: "Then watch you For
          the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible 
          ... Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall 
          seize You with a mighty grasp. (44.10-16) Ibn Masud added, "Al-Batsha 
          (i.e. grasp) happened in the battle of Badr and no doubt smoke, 
          Al-Batsha, Al-Lizam, and the verse of Surat Ar-Rum have all passed .

          Talib: And a white (person) (i.e. the Prophet) who is requested to 
          pray for rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of
          widows." Salim's father (Ibn 'Umar) said, "The following poetic verse 
          occurred to my mind while I was looking at the face of the Prophet 
          (p.b.u.h) while he was praying for rain. He did not get down till the 
          rain water flowed profusely from every roof-g utter: And a white 
          (person) who is requested to pray for rain and who takes care of the 
          orphans and is the guardian of widows . . . And these were the words 
          of Abu Talib."

          "O Allah! We used to ask our Prophet to invoke You for rain, and You 
          would bless us with rain, and now we ask his uncle to invoke You for 
          rain. O Allah ! Bless us with rain."(1) And so it would rain.

        <p> Narrated Sharik bin 'Abdullah bin Abi Namir:
        <p> I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "On a Friday a person entered the main 
          Mosque through the gate facing the pulpit while Allah's Apostle was 
          delivering the Khutba. The man stood in front of Allah's Apostle and 
          said, 'O Allah's Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are 
          cut off; so please pray to Allah for rain.' " Anas added, "Allah's 
          Apostle (p.b.u.h) raised both his hands and said, 'O Allah! Bless us 
          with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain!' 
          " Anas added, "By Allah, we could not see any trace of cloud in the 
          sky and there was no building or a house between us and (the mountains
          of) Sila." Anas added, "A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from 
          behind it (i.e. Sila' Mountain). When it came in the middle of the 
          sky, it spread and then rained." Anas further said, "By Allah! We 
          could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through
          the same gate and at that time Allah's Apostle was delivering the 
          Friday's Khutba. The man stood in front of him and said, 'O Allah's 
          Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are cut off, please 
          pray to Allah to with-hold rain.' " Anas added, "Allah's Apostle I 
          raised both his hands and said, 'O Allah! Round about us and not on 
          us. O Allah! On the plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the 
          valleys and on the places where trees grow.' So the rain stopped and 
          we came out walking in the sun." Sharik asked Anas whether it was the 
          same person who had asked for the rain (the last Friday). Anas replied
          that he did not know.

          cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Silas Mountain) and

          Allah! We could not see the sun for a week. The next Friday, a person

          whether it was the same person who had asked for rain the previous 
          Friday. Anas replied that he did not know.

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Masruq:
        <p> One day I went to Ibn Masud  who said, "When Quraish delayed in 
          embracing Islam, the Prophet I invoked Allah to curse them, so they 
          were afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many of them died
          and they ate the carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and 
          said, 'O Muhammad! You came to order people to keep good relation with
          kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so invoke Allah I ? 
          So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: 'Then 
          watch you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke 
          Plainly visible.' (44.10) When the famine was taken off, the people 
          renegade once again as nonbelievers. The statement of Allah, (in Sura 
          "Ad-Dukhan"-44) refers to that: 'On the day when We shall seize You 
          with a mighty grasp.' (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of
          the battle of Badr." Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, "Allah's
          Apostle prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the 
          people complained of the excessive rain. The Prophet said, 'O Allah! 
          (Let it rain) around us and not on us.' So the clouds dispersed over 
          his head and it rained over the surroundings."

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Anas:
        <p> Allah's Apostle I was delivering the Khutba (sermon) on a Friday when 
          the people stood up, shouted and said, "O Allah's Apostle! There is no
          rain (drought), the trees have dried and the livestock are destroyed; 
          Please pray to Allah for rain." So Allah's Apostle said twice, "O 
          Allah! Bless us with rain." By Allah, there was no trace of cloud in 
          the sky and suddenly the sky became overcast with clouds and it 
          started raining. The Prophet came down the pulpit and offered the 
          prayer. When he came back from the prayer (to his house) it was 
          raining and it rained continuously till the next Friday. When the 
          Prophet  started delivering the Friday Khutba (sermon), the people 
          started shouting and said to him, "The houses have collapsed and the 
          roads are cut off; so please pray to Allah to withhold the rain." So 
          the Prophet smiled and said, "O Allah! Round about us and not on us." 
          So the sky became clear over Medina but it kept on raining over the 
          outskirts (of Medina) and not a single drop of rain fell over Median. 
          I looked towards the sky which was as bright and clear as a crown.

        <p> In the life-time of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) the people were 
          afflicted with a (famine) year. While the Prophet was delivering the 
          Khutba (sermon) on the pulpit on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and 
          said, "O Allah's Apostle! The livestock are dying and the families 
          (offspring) are hungry: please pray to Allah to bless us with rain." 
          Allah's Apostle raised both his hands towards the sky and at that time
          there was not a trace of cloud in they sky. Then the clouds started 
          gathering like mountains. Before he got down from the pulpit I saw 
          rain-water trickling down his beard. It rained that day, the next day,
          the third day, the fourth day and till the next Friday, when the same 
          Bedouin or some other person stood up (during the Friday Khutba) and 
          said, "O Allah's Apostle! The houses have collapsed and the livestock 
          are drowned. Please invoke Allah for us." So Allah's Apostle raised 
          both his hands and said, "O Allah! Around us and not on us." Whichever
          side the Prophet directed his hand, the clouds dispersed from there 
          till a hole (in the clouds) was formed over Medina. The valley of 
          Qanat remained flowing (with water) for one month and none, came from 
          outside who didn't talk about the abundant rain.
