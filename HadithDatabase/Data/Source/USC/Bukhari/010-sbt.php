        <p> Once'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz delayed the prayer and 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair 
          went to him and said, "Once in 'Iraq, Al-MughTra bin Shu'ba delayed 
          his prayers and Abi Mas'ud Al-Ansari went to him and said, 'O Mughira!
          What is this? Don't you know that once Gabriel came and offered the 
          prayer (Fajr prayer) and Allah's Apostle prayed too, then he prayed 
          again (Zuhr prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and again he prayed 
          ('Asr prayers and Allah's Apostle did the same; again he prayed 
          (Maghrib-prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and again prayed ('Isha 
          prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and (Gabriel) said, 'I was ordered 
          to do so (to demonstrate the prayers prescribed to you)?'" 'Umar (bin 
          'Abdul 'AzTz) said to 'Urwa, "Be sure of what you Say. Did Gabriel 
          lead Allah's Apostle at the stated times of the prayers?" 'Urwa 
          replied, "Bashir bin Abi Mas'ud narrated like this on the authority of
          his father." Urwa added, "Aisha told me that Allah's Apostle used to 
          pray 'Asr prayer when the sun-shine was still inside her residence 
          (during the early time of 'Asr)."

        <p> "Once a delegation of 'Abdul Qais came to Allah's Apostle and said, 
          "We belong to such and such branch of the tribe of Rab'a and we can 
          only come to you in the sacred months. Order us to do something good 
          so that we may (carry out) take it from you and also invite to it our 
          people whom we have left behind (at home)." The Prophet said, " I 
          order you to do four things and forbid you from four things. (The 
          first four are as follows):
        <p> 1. To believe in Allah. (And then he: explained it to them i.e.) to 
          testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and 
          (Muhammad) am Allah's Apostle
        <p> 2. To offer prayers perfectly (at the stated times):
        <p> 3. To pay Zakat (obligatory charity)
        <p> 4. To give me Khumus
        <p> (The other four things which are forbidden are as follows):
        <p> 1. Dubba
        <p> 2. Hantam
        <p> 3. Muqaiyat
        <p> 4. Naqir (all these are utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic

        <p> Narrated Shaqiq:
        <p> that he had heard Hudhaifa saying, "Once I was sitting with 'Umar and 
          he said, 'Who amongst you remembers the statement of Allah's Apostle 
          about the afflictions?' I said, 'I know it as the Prophet had said 
          it.' 'Umar said, 'No doubt you are bold.' I said, 'The afflictions 
          caused for a man by his wife, money, children and neighbor are 
          expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is 
          good) and forbidding (what is evil).' 'Umar said, 'I did not mean that
          but I asked about that affliction which will spread like the waves of 
          the sea.' I (Hudhaifa) said, 'O leader of the faithful believers! You 
          need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and 
          it.' 'Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'It 
          will be broken.' 'Umar said, 'Then it will never be closed again.' I 
          was asked whether 'Umar knew that door. I replied that he knew it as 
          one knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I 
          narrated a Hadith that was free from any mis-statement" The 
          subnarrator added that they deputed Masruq to ask Hudhaifa (about the 
          door). Hudhaifa said, "The door was 'Umar himself."

        <p> And offer prayers perfectly At the two ends of the day And in some 
          hours of the night (i.e. the five compulsory prayers). Verily! good 
          deeds remove (annul) the evil deeds (small sins) (11.114).  The man

          "What is the next (in goodness)?" He replied, "To be good and dutiful

          have never seen a better thing (than the former) and a worse thing

          increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was 
          more than it was before its serving.
        <p> Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving
          or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) 'O the sister 
          of Bani Firas! What is this?' She said, 'O the pleasure of my eyes! 
          The food is now three times more than it was before.' Abu Bakr ate 
          from it, and said, 'That (oath) was from Satan' meaning his oath (not 
          to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took

          There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of 
          that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us into twelve (groups) 
          (the Prophet's companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how
          many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 
          groups of men) ate of that meal."
