            will all my property (in charity)?" He said, "No." I said, "Then may I

            leave your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor begging others,

            charitable deed even the handful of food you put in your wife's mouth.

            and some others be harmed by you." At that time Sad had only one

            his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas saying, "The son of the slave-girl of 
            Zam'a is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody." So during the 
            year of the Conquest (of Mecca) Sad took the boy and said, "This is my
            brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me." 'Abu bin Zam's got up 
            and said, "He is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father
            and was born on my father's bed." Then both of them came to Allah's 
            Apostle and Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is my brother's son 
            whom my brother entrusted to me."
          <p> Then 'Abu bin Zam'a got up and said, "This is my brother and the son 
            of the slave-girl of my father." Allah's Apostle said, "O Abu bin 
            Zam'a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was
            born), and for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation)." Then 
            the Prophet said to his wife Sauda bint Zam'a, "Screen yourself from 
            this boy," when he saw the boy's resemblance to 'Utba. Since then the 
            boy did not see Sauda till he died.

            "Who has done so to you, so-and-so? So-and-so?" Till the name of the 
            Jew was mentioned, whereupon she nodded (in agreement). So the Jew was
            brought and was questioned till he confessed. The Prophet then ordered
            that his head be crushed with stones.

            they would inherit by the will of the deceased. Then Allah cancelled 
            from that custom whatever He wished and fixed for the male double the

            whole legacy) and for the wife an eighth or a fourth and for the

            gave me and said, 'O Hakim! This wealth is green and sweet (i.e. as 
            tempting as fruits), and whoever takes it with
          <p> The upper (i.e. giving) hand is better than the lower (i.e. taking) 
            hand." Hakim added, "I said, O Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent 
            you with the Truth I will never demand anything from anybody after you
            till I die." Afterwards Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him 
            something but he refused to accept anything from him. Then 'Umar 
            called him to give him (something) but he refused. Then 'Umar said, "O
            Muslims! I offered to him (i.e. Hakim) his share which Allah has 
            ordained for him from this booty and he refuses to take it." Thus 
            Hakim did not ask anybody for anything after the Prophet, till he 
            died--may Allah bestow His mercy upon him.

          <p> Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the 
            Quranic Verse:--
          <p> "And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls 
            then marry (other) women of your choice." (4.2-3)
          <p> Aisha said, "It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her
            guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth,
            and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of
            her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the 
            orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they
            were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people
            asked Allah's Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following 
            Verse:--
          <p> "They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah 
            instructs you regarding them..." (4.127)
          <p> and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was 
            beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her
            without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could 
            get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he 
            would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of 
            her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards
            her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her,
            unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing 
            all her rights.
