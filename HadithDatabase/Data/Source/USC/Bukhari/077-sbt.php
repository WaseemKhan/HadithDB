        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah:
        <p> Allah's Apostle, the truthful and truly-inspired, said, "Each one of 
          you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns
          into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece
          of flesh for a similar period (of forty days) and then Allah sends an 
          angel and orders him to write four things, i.e., his provision, his 
          age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the blessed (in the 
          Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Allah, a person
          among you (or a man) may do deeds of the people of the Fire till there
          is only a cubit or an arm-breadth distance between him and the Fire, 
          but then that writing (which Allah has ordered the angel to write) 
          precedes, and he does the deeds of the people of Paradise and enters 
          it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise till there is
          only a cubit or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing 
          precedes and he does the deeds of the people of the Fire and enters 
          it."

        <p> Narrated Anas bin Malik:
        <p> The Prophet said, "Allah puts an angel in charge of the uterus and the
          angel says, 'O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O 
          Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes to 
          complete its creation, the angel asks, 'O Lord, (will it be) a male or
          a female? A wretched (an evil doer) or a blessed (doer of good)? How 
          much will his provisions be? What will his age be?' So all that is 
          written while the creature is still in the mother's womb."

          "Yes." The man said, "Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?" The 
          Prophet said, "Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been 
          created to do or he will do those deeds which will be made easy for 
          him to do." (i.e. everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will

          his daughters, telling him that her child was on the verge of death.

          takes, and it is for Allah what He gives, and everything has its fixed
          time (limit). So (she should) be patient and look for Allah's

          of you but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise." 
          Thereupon a man from the people said, "Shall we not depend upon this, 
          O Allah's Apostle?" The Prophet said, "No, but carry on and do your 
          deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such deeds (as will lead him

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> We witnessed along with Allah's Apostle the Khaibar (campaign). 
          Allah's Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a 
          Muslim, "This man is from the people of the Fire." When the battle 
          started, the man fought very bravely and received a great number of 
          wounds and got crippled. On that, a man from among the companions of 
          the Prophet came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Do you know what the 
          man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought
          very bravely for Allah's Cause and he has received many wounds." The 
          Prophet said, "But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire." Some 
          of the Muslims were about to have some doubt about that statement. So 
          while the man was in that state, the pain caused by the wounds 
          troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took out
          an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among 
          the Muslims to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Allah has
          made your statement true. So-and-so has committed suicide." Allah's 
          Apostle said, "O Bilal! Get up and announce in public: None will enter
          Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this religion (Islam) 
          with a wicked man."

        <p> Narrated Sahl bin Sa'd:
        <p> There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims on behalf 
          of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The
          Prophet looked at him and said. "If anyone would like to see a man 
          from the people of the Fire, let him look at this (brave man)." On 
          that, a man from the People (Muslims) followed him, and he was in that
          state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he was wounded, 
          and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his 
          breasts (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his
          shoulders. Then the man (who was watching that person) went quickly to
          the Prophet and said, "I testify that you are Allah's Apostle!" The 
          Prophet asked him, "Why do you say that?" He said, "You said about 
          so-and-so, 'If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the 
          Fire, he should look at him.' He fought most bravely of all of us on 
          behalf of the Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim 
          (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he hastened to die and committed 
          suicide." There-upon the Prophet said, "A man may do the deeds of the 
          people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise, 
          and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he 
          belongs to the people of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds 
          are decided by the last actions (deeds)".

        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:
        <p> I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu Huraira 
          said from the Prophet, who said, "Allah has written for the son of 
          Adam his inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or 
          not: The adultery of the eye is the looking (at something which is 
          sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is to utter (what 
          it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for 
          (adultery) and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain 
          from submitting to the temptation."

        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:
        <p> (regarding the Verse) "And We granted the vision (Ascension to the 
          heavens "Miraj") which We showed you (O Muhammad as an actual eye 
          witness) but as a trial for mankind.' (17.60):  Allah's Apostle 
          actually saw with his own eyes the vision (all the things which were 
          shown to him) on the night of his Night Journey to Jerusalem (and then
          to the heavens). The cursed tree which is mentioned in the Qur'an is 
          the tree of Az-Zaqqum.

        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> The Prophet said, "Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said 
          to Adam. 'O Adam! You are our father who disappointed us and turned us
          out of Paradise.' Then Adam said to him, 'O Moses! Allah favored you 
          with His talk (talked to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for 
          you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for action which Allah had 
          written in my fate forty years before my creation?' So Adam confuted 
          Moses, Adam confuted Moses," the Prophet added, repeating the 
          Statement three times.

          'Write to me what you heard the Prophet saying after his prayer.' So 
          Al-Mughira dictated to me and said, "I heard the Prophet saying after 
          the prayer, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who 
          has no partner. O Allah! No-one can withhold what You give, and none

          for you)." On that, 'Umar said (to the Prophet ), "Allow me to chop

          Ad-Dajjal), then you will not be able to overcome him, and if he is

          He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is 
          residing in a town in which this disease is present, and remains there
          and does not leave that town, but has patience and hopes for Allah's 
          reward, and knows that nothing will befall him except what Allah has

          earth with us and saying, "By Allah, without Allah we would not have 
          been guided, neither would we have fasted, nor would we have prayed. O
          Allah! Send down Sakina (calmness) upon us and make our feet firm when
          we meet (the enemy). The pagans have rebelled against us, but if they 
          want to put us in affliction (i.e., fight us) we refuse (to flee)."
