        <p> Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaidullah:
        <p> A bedouin with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O 
          Allah's Apostle! Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards 
          prayers." The Prophet said, "You have to offer perfectly the five 
          (compulsory) prayers in a day and a night (24 hrs.), except if you 
          want to perform some extra optional prayers." The bedouin said, "Tell 
          me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards fasting." The Prophet 
          said, "You have to observe fast during the month of Ramadan except if 
          you fast some extra optional fast." The bedouin said, "Tell me what 
          Allah has enjoined on me as regard Zakat." The Prophet then told him 
          the Islamic laws and regulations whereupon the bedouin said, "By Him 
          Who has honored you, I will not perform any optional deeds of worship 
          and I will not leave anything of what Allah has enjoined on me." 
          Allah's Apostle said, "He will be successful if he has told the truth 
          (or he will enter Paradise if he said the truth)." And some people 
          said, "The Zakat for one-hundred and twenty camels is two Hiqqas, and 
          if the Zakat payer slaughters the camels intentionally or gives them 
          as a present or plays some other trick in order to avoid the Zakat, 
          then there is no harm (in it) for him.

        <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
        <p> Allah's Apostle said, "On the Day of Resurrection the Kanz (Treasure 
          or wealth of which, Zakat has not been paid) of anyone of you will 
          appear in the shape of a huge bald headed poisonous male snake and its
          owner will run away from it, but it will follow him and say, 'I am 
          your Kanz.'" The Prophet added, "By Allah, that snake will keep on 
          following him until he stretches out his hand and let the snake 
          swallow it." Allah's Apostle added, "If the owner of camels does not 
          pay their Zakat, then, on the Day of Resurrection those camels will 
          come to him and will strike his face with their hooves." Some people 
          said: Concerning a man who has camels, and is afraid that Zakat will 
          be due so he sells those camels for similar camels or for sheep or 
          cows or money one day before Zakat becomes due in order to avoid 
          payment of their Zakat cunningly! "He has not to pay anything." The 
          same scholar said, "If one pays Zakat of his camels one day or one 
          year prior to the end of the year (by the end of which Zakat becomes 
          due), his Zakat will be valid."

          Allah's Apostle said, "Fulfill it on her behalf." Some people said,

          completion of a year, then he is not to pay anything, and if he

          "Her silence means her consent." Some people said, "If a man falls in 
          love with an orphan slave girl or a virgin and she refuses (him) and 
          then he makes a trick by bringing two false witnesses to testify that 
          he has married her, and then she attains the age of puberty and agrees
          to marry him and the judge accepts the false witness and the husband 
          knows that the witnesses were false ones, he may consummate his 
          marriage."

        <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
        <p> Allah's Apostle used to like sweets and also used to like honey, and 
          whenever he finished the 'Asr prayer, he used to visit his wives and 
          stay with them. Once he visited Hafsa and remained with her longer 
          than the period he used to stay, so I enquired about it. It was said 
          to me, "A woman from her tribe gave her a leather skin containing 
          honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Allah's Apostle to 
          drink." I said, "By Allah, we will play a trick on him." So I 
          mentioned the story to Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) and said to 
          her, "When he enters upon you, he will come near to you whereupon you 
          should say to him, 'O Allah's Apostle! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He 
          will say, 'No.' Then you say to him, 'What is this bad smell? ' And it
          would be very hard on Allah's Apostle that a bad smell should be found
          on his body. He will say, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' Then 
          you should say to him, 'Its bees must have sucked from the Al-'Urfut 
          (a foul smelling flower).' I too, will tell him the same. And you, O 
          Saifya, say the same."
        <p> So when the Prophet entered upon Sauda (the following happened). Sauda
          said, "By Him except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I was 
          about to say to him what you had told me to say while he was still at 
          the gate because of fear from you. But when Allah 's Apostle came near
          to me, I said to him, 'O Allah's Apostle! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He
          replied, 'No.' I said, 'What about this smell?' He said, 'Hafsa has 
          given me a drink of honey.' I said, 'Its bees must have sucked 
          Al-'Urfut.' " When he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, 
          and when he entered upon Safiya, she too told him the same. So when he
          visited Hafsa again, she said to him, "O Allah's Apostle! Shall I give
          you a drink of it (honey)?" He said, "I have no desire for it." Sauda 
          said, Subhan Allah! We have deprived him of it (honey)." I said to 
          her, "Be quiet!"

        <p> The Prophet has decreed that preemption is valid in all cases where 
          the real estate concerned has not been divided, but if the boundaries 
          are established and the ways are made, then there is no preemption. A 
          man said, "Preemption is only for the neighbor," and then he makes 
          invalid what he has confirmed. He said, "If someone wants to buy a 
          house and being afraid that the neighbor (of the house) may buy it 
          through preemption, he buys one share out of one hundred shares of the
          house and then buys the rest of the house, then the neighbor can only 
          have the right of preemption for the first share but not for the rest

          this (i.e. Sa'd) to buy my house which is in my yard?" Sa'd said, "I 
          will not offer more than four hundred in installments over a fixed 
          period." Abu Rafi said, "I was offered five hundred cash but I 
          refused. Had I not heard the Prophet saying, 'A neighbor is more 
          entitled to receive the care of his neighbor,' I would not have sold 
          it to you." The narrator said, to Sufyan: Ma'mar did not say so.

          wants to sell a house and deprived somebody of the right of 
          preemption, he has the right to play a trick to render the preemption 
          invalid. And that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present and
          marking its boundaries and giving it to him. The buyer then gives the 
          seller one-thousand Dirham as compensation in which case the preemptor
          loses his right of preemption."

        <p> Allah's Apostle appointed a man called Ibn Al-Lutabiyya to collect the
          Zakat from Bani Sulaim's tribe. When he returned, the Prophet called 
          him to account. He said (to the Prophet,  'This is your money, and 
          this has been given to me as a gift." On that, Allah's Apostle said, 
          "Why didn't you stay in your father's and mother's house to see 
          whether you will be given gifts or not if you are telling the truth?" 
          Then the Prophet addressed us, and after praising and glorifying 
          Allah, he said: "Amma Ba'du", I employ a man from among you to manage 
          some affair of what Allah has put under my custody, and then he comes 
          to me and says, 'This is your money and this has been given to me as a
          gift. Why didn't he stay in his father's and mother's home to see 
          whether he will be given gifts or not? By Allah, not anyone of you 
          takes a thing unlawfully but he will meet Allah on the Day of 
          Resurrection, carrying that thing. I do not want to see any of you 
          carrying a grunting camel or a mooing cow or a bleating sheep on 
          meeting Allah." Then the Prophet raised both his hands till the 
          whiteness of his armpits became visible, and he said, "O Allah! 
          Haven't I have conveyed (Your Message)?" The narrator added: My eyes

        <p> Narrated Abu Rafi':
        <p> The Prophet said, "The neighbor has more right to be taken care of by 
          his neighbor (than anyone else)." Some men said, "If one wants to buy 
          a house for 20,000 Dirhams then there is no harm to play a trick to 
          deprive somebody of preemption by buying it (just on paper) with 
          20,000 Dirhams but paying to the seller only 9,999 Dirhams in cash and
          then agree with the seller to pay only one Dinar in cash for the rest 
          of the price (i.e. 10,001 Dirhams). If the preemptor offers 20,000 
          Dirhams for the house, he can buy it otherwise he has no right to buy 
          it (by this trick he got out of preemption). If the house proves to 
          belong to somebody else other than the seller, the buyer should take 
          back from the seller what he has paid, i.e., 9,999 Dirhams and one 
          Dinar, because if the house proves to belong to somebody else, so the 
          whole bargain (deal) is unlawful. If the buyer finds a defect in the 
          house and it does not belong to somebody other than the seller, the 
          buyer may return it and receive 20,000 Dirhams (instead of 9999 Dirham
          plus one Dinar) which he actually paid.' Abu 'Abdullah said, "So that 
          man allows (some people) the playing of tricks amongst the Muslims 
          (although) the Prophet said, 'In dealing with Muslims one should not 
          sell them sick (animals) or bad things or stolen things."
