          Prophet that it had been finished. The Prophet asked her to send that

        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami:
        <p> That his father said, "One day I was sitting with some of the 
          Prophet's companions on the way to Mecca. Allah's Apostle was ahead of
          us. All of my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a 
          non-Muhrim. They saw an onager while I was busy repairing my shoes, so
          they did not tell me about it but they wished I had seen it. By chance
          I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and rode
          on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they
          could hand over to me the whip and the spear but they said, 'No, by 
          Allah, we shall not help you in that in any way.' I became angry and 
          got down from the horse, picked up both the things and rode the horse 
          again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after
          it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating
          it, but they doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not,
          as they were in the state of Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me
          one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah's Apostle and asked him about 
          the case, he asked, 'Do you have a portion of it with you?' I replied 
          in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy fore-leg which he ate 
          completely while he was in the state of Ihram .

        <p> Narrated Anas:
        <p> Once Allah's Apostle visited us in this house of ours and asked for 
          something to drink. We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water
          from this well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his
          left side and 'Umar in front of him and a bedouin on his right side. 
          When Allah's Apostle finished, 'Umar said to Allah's Apostle "Here is 
          Abu Bakr." But Allah's Apostle gave the remaining milk to the bedouin 
          and said twice, "The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the 
          right side." Anas added, "It is a Sunna (the Prophet's traditions)" 
          and repeated it thrice.

          who slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah's Apostle. 
          (The narrator confirms that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted 
          that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas, "Did the Prophet; eat from it?"

          rejected your gift, but we are in the state of Ihram." (i.e. if we

          "Buy and manumit her, as the Wala' is for the liberator." Once Buraira
          was given some meat, and the Prophet asked, "What is this?" I said, 
          "It has been given to Buraira in charity." He said, "It is sadaqa for 
          her but a gift for us." Buraira was given the option (to stay with her
          husband or to part with him). AbdurRahman (a sub-narrator) wondered, 
          "Was her husband a slave or a free man?" Shu'ba (another sub-narrator)

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated 'Urwa from 'Aisha:
        <p> The wives of Allah's Apostle were in two groups. One group consisted 
          of 'Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of 
          Um Salama and the other wives of Allah's Apostle. The Muslims knew 
          that Allah's Apostle loved 'Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and 
          wished to give to Allah's Apostle, he would delay it, till Allah's 
          Apostle had come to 'Aisha's home and then he would send his gift to 
          Allah's Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the 
          matter together and decided that Um Salama should request Allah's 
          Apostle to tell the people to send their gifts to him in whatever 
          wife's house he was. Um Salama told Allah's Apostle of what they had 
          said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama 
          about it. She said, "He did not say anything to me." They asked her to
          talk to him again. She talked to him again when she met him on her 
          day, but he gave no reply. When they asked her, she replied that he 
          had given no reply. They said to her, "Talk to him till he gives you a
          reply." When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to
          her, "Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do 
          not come to me on any of the beds except that of Aisha." On that Um 
          Salama said, "I repent to Allah for hurting you." Then the group of Um
          Salama called Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle and sent her to 
          Allah's Apostle to say to him, "Your wives request to treat them and 
          the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms." Then Fatima conveyed the 
          message to him. The Prophet said, "O my daughter! Don't you love whom 
          I love?" She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of 
          the situation. They requested her to go to him again but she refused. 
          They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him and used harsh words 
          saying, "Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter of Ibn 
          Abu Quhafa on equal terms." On that she raised her voice and abused 
          'Aisha to her face so much so that Allah's Apostle looked at 'Aisha to
          see whether she would retort. 'Aisha started replying to Zainab till 
          she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at 'Aisha and said, "She is 
          really the daughter of Abu Bakr."
