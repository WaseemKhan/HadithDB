            Apostle 'Hold to forgiveness, command what is good (right), and leave 
            the foolish (i.e. do not punish them).' (7.199) and this person is 
            among the foolish." By Allah, 'Umar did not overlook that Verse when 
            Al-Hurr recited it before him, and 'Umar said to observe (the orders 
            of) Allah's Book strictly." (See Hadith No. 166, Vol. 6)

            the Prophet did not order him to do so. Later on this practice of 
            divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li'an.
            The Prophet said (to the people). "Wait for her! If she delivers a red

            child that proved the accusation. (See Hadith No. 269, Vol. 6)

          <p> Narrated Malik bin Aus An-Nasri:
          <p> I proceeded till I entered upon 'Umar (and while I was sitting there),
            his gate-keeper Yarfa came to him and said, " 'Uthman, 'Abdur-Rahman, 
            Az-Zubair and Sa'd ask your permission to come in." 'Umar allowed 
            them. So they entered, greeted, and sat down. (After a while the 
            gatekeeper came) and said, "Shall I admit 'Ali and 'Abbas?'' 'Umar 
            allowed them to enter. Al-'Abbas said "O Chief of the believers! Judge
            between me and the oppressor ('Ali)." Then there was a dispute 
            (regarding the property of Bani Nadir) between them ('Abbas and 'Ali).
            'Uthman and his companions said, "O Chief of the Believers! Judge 
            between them and relieve one from the other." Umar said, "Be patient! 
            beseech you by Allah, with Whose permission the Heaven and the Earth 
            Exist! Do you know that Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property is not to 
            be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity,' and by
            this Allah's Apostle meant himself?" On that the group said, "He 
            verily said so." 'Umar then faced 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, "I beseech
            you both by Allah, do you both know that Allah's Apostle said so?" 
            They both replied, "Yes". 'Umar then said, "Now I am talking to you 
            about this matter (in detail) . Allah favored Allah's Apostle with 
            some of this wealth which He did not give to anybody else, as Allah 
            said: 'What Allah bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you 
            made no expedition... ' (59.6)
          <p> So that property was totally meant for Allah's Apostle, yet he did not
            collect it and ignore you, nor did he withhold it with your exclusion,
            but he gave it to you and distributed it among you till this much of 
            it was left behind, and the Prophet, used to spend of this as the 
            yearly expenditures of his family and then take what remained of it 
            and spent it as he did with (other) Allah's wealth. The Prophet did so
            during all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Allah, do you know 
            that?" They replied, "Yes." 'Umar then addressed 'Ali and 'Abbas, 
            saying, "I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that?" Both of them 
            replied, "Yes." 'Umar added, "Then Allah took His Apostle unto Him. 
            Abu Bakr then said 'I am the successor of Allah's Apostle' and took 
            over all the Prophet's property and disposed of it in the same way as 
            Allah's Apostle used to do, and you were present then." Then he turned
            to 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, "You both claim that Abu Bakr did 
            so-and-so in managing the property, but Allah knows that Abu Bakr was 
            honest, righteous, intelligent, and a follower of what is right in 
            managing it. 
          <p> Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him, 'I said: I am the successor of 
            Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr.' So I took over the property for two 
            years and managed it in the same way as Allah's Apostle, and Abu Bakr 
            used to do. Then you both ('Ali and 'Abbas) came to me and asked for 
            the same thing! (O 'Abbas! You came to me to ask me for your share 
            from nephew's property; and this ('Ali) came to me asking for his 
            wives share from her father's property, and I said to you both, 'If 
            you wish, I will place it in your custody on condition that you both 
            will manage it in the same way as Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr did and
            as I have been doing since I took charge of managing it; otherwise, do
            not speak to me anymore about it.' 
          <p> Then you both said, 'Give it to us on that (condition).' So I gave it 
            to you on that condition. Now I beseech you by Allah, did I not give 
            it to them on that condition?" The group (whom he had been addressing)
            replied, "Yes." 'Umar then addressed 'Abbas and 'Ali saying, "I 
            beseech you both by Allah, didn't I give you all that property on that
            condition?" They said, "Yes." 'Umar then said, "Are you now seeking a 
            verdict from me other than that? By Him with Whose Permission the 
            Heaven and the Earth exists I will not give any verdict other than 
            that till the Hour is established; and if you both are unable to 
            manage this property, then you can hand it back to me, and I will be 
            sufficient for it on your behalf." (See, Hadith No. 326, Vol. 4)

          <p> Narrated Abu Huraira:
          <p> Allah's Apostle said, "Horses may be used for three purposes: For a 
            man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a 
            means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for 
            whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for 
            Allah's Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a 
            pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that
            pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they 
            break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps 
            and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a 
            river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering 
            them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such 
            horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps 
            horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg 
            his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allah's right of 
            what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to 
            be used in Allah's Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from 
            poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing
            off, they are a source of sin." Then Allah's Apostle was asked about 
            donkeys. He said, "Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding 
            them except this comprehensive Verse:
          <p> "Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a 
            small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the 
            weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it."  (99.7-8)

            without 'Umra." Jabir added, "The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) on the

            ordered us to finish the state of Ihram, saying, "Finish your lhram

            did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for
            us. Then he heard that we were saying, "When there remains only five 
            days between us and the Day of Arafat he orders us to finish our Ihram
            by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to 'Arafat 
            with our male organs dribbling with semen?' (Jabir pointed out with 
            his hand illustrating what he was saying). Allah's Apostle stood up 
            and said, 'You (People) know that I am the most Allah-fearing, the 
            most truthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. 
            If I had not brought the Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram 
            as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly known what I 
            came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me.' So we
            finished our Ihram and listened to the Prophet and obeyed him." (See
