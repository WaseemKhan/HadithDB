          rewarded by Allah. And whoever indulges in any one of them (except the
          ascription of partners to Allah) and gets the punishment in this 
          world, that punishment will be an expiation for that sin. And if one

        <p> When the Prophet came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers
          or maternal uncles from Ansar. He offered his prayers facing 
          Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he 
          wished that he could pray facing the Ka'ba (at Mecca). The first 
          prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the 
          company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer 
          with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were 
          bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing 
          them, "By Allah, I testify that I have prayed with Allah's Apostle 
          facing Mecca (Ka'ba).' Hearing that, those people changed their 
          direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the 
          scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet facing Jerusalem in 
          prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during 
          the prayers, they disapproved of it.
        <p> Al-Bara' added, "Before we changed our direction towards the Ka'ba 
          (Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we 
          did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers.) Allah 
          then revealed: And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be 
          lost (i.e. the prayers of those Muslims were valid).' " (2:143).

          you regret." They said, "O Allah's Apostle! We cannot come to you 
          except in the sacred month and there is the infidel tribe of Mudar 
          intervening between you and us. So please order us to do something 
          good (religious deeds) so that we may inform our people whom we have 
          left behind (at home), and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on 
          them)." Then they asked about drinks (what is legal and what is 
          illegal). The Prophet ordered them to do four things and forbade them 
          from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone and asked 
          them, "Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?" They 
          replied, "Allah and His Apostle know better." Thereupon the Prophet 
          said, "It means:
        <p> 1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and 
          Muhammad is Allah's Apostle. 
        <p> 2. To offer prayers perfectly
        <p> 3. To pay the Zakat (obligatory charity) 
        <p> 4. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.
        <p> 5. And to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's
          Cause).
        <p> Then he forbade them four things, namely, Hantam, Dubba,' Naqir Ann 
          Muzaffat or Muqaiyar; (These were the names of pots in which Alcoholic
          drinks were prepared) (The Prophet mentioned the container of wine and
          he meant the wine itself). The Prophet further said (to them): 
          "Memorize them (these instructions) and convey them to the people whom
          you have left behind."

          and every person will get the reward according to what he has 
          intended. So whoever emigrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his 
          emigration was for Allah and His Apostle. And whoever emigrated for 
          worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what 
          he emigrated for."

        <p> I heard Jarir bin 'Abdullah (Praising Allah). On the day when 
          Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba died, he (Jarir) got up (on the pulpit) and 
          thanked and praised Allah and said, "Be afraid of Allah alone Who has 
          none along with Him to be worshipped.(You should) be calm and quiet 
          till the (new) chief comes to you and he will come to you soon. Ask 
          Allah's forgiveness for your (late) chief because he himself loved to 
          forgive others." Jarir added, "Amma badu (now then), I went to the 
          Prophet and said, 'I give my pledge of allegiance to you for Islam." 
          The Prophet conditioned (my pledge) for me to be sincere and true to 
          every Muslim so I gave my pledge to him for this. By the Lord of this 
          mosque! I am sincere and true to you (Muslims). Then Jarir asked for 
          Allah's forgiveness and came down (from the pulpit).
