          of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's 
          Apostle ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to 
          your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence

          Apostle told me to undo my hair and comb it and to postpone the 'Umra.

          place outside Mecca where the pilgrims go after finishing all the 
          ceremonies Hajj at Mina) he (the Prophet ordered 'Abdur Rahman

          for'Umra in lieu of that of Hajj-atTamattu' which I had intended to

        <p> On the 1st of Dhul-Hijja we set out with the intention of performing 
          Hajj. Allah's Apostle said, "Any one who likes to assume the Ihram for
          'Umra he can do so. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have 
          assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. "Some of us assumed the Ihram for 'Umra 
          while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who 
          assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating 
          until the day of 'Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet . He 
          told me to postpone my 'Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assure the
          Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On the right of Hasba, he sent my brother 
          'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to At-Tah'im, where I assumed the 
          Ihram for'Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, "For that
