            Ad-Dail and the tribe of Bani 'Abu bin 'Adi as a guide. He was an

            with the tribe of Al-'Asi bin Wail and he was on the religion of 
            Quraish pagans. The Prophet and Abu Bakr had confidence in him and

            Thaur after three days. So, he brought them their two riding camels 
            after three days and both of them (The Prophet and Abu Bakr) set out 
            accompanied by 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the Dili guide who guided them

            other's finger and caused his own tooth to fall out. He then went to 
            the Prophet (with a complaint) but the Prophet cancelled the suit and 
            said to the complainant, "Did you expect him to let his finger in your
            mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?"

            quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take your full wages.' 
            But they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after 
            them and said to them, 'Complete the rest of the day and yours will be
            the wages I had fixed for the first batch.' So, they worked till the 
            time of 'Asr prayer. Then they said, "Let what we have done be 
            annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.' The 
            man said to them, 'Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of 
            the day remains,' but they refused. Thereafter he employed another 
            batch to work for the rest of the day and they worked for the rest of 
            the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two former
            batches. So, that was the example of those people (Muslims) and the 
            example of this light (guidance) which they have accepted willingly.

          <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:
          <p> I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Three men from among those who were 
            before you, set out together till they reached a cave at night and 
            entered it. A big rock rolled down the mountain and closed the mouth 
            of the cave. They said (to each other), Nothing could save you Tom 
            this rock but to invoke Allah by giving referenda to the righteous 
            deed which you have done (for Allah's sake only).' So, one of them 
            said, 'O Allah! I had old parents and I never provided my family 
            (wife, children etc.) with milk before them. One day, by chance I was 
            delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had slept. I milked the
            sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I
            disliked to provide my family with the milk before them. I waited for 
            them and the bowl of milk was in my hand and I kept on waiting for 
            them to get up till the day dawned. Then they got up and drank the 
            milk. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us 
            from our critical situation caused by this rock.' So, the rock shifted
            a little but they could not get out."
          <p> The Prophet added, "The second man said, 'O Allah! I had a cousin who 
            was the dearest of all people to me and I wanted to have sexual 
            relations with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a 
            famine year and she came to me and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty 
            Dinars on the condition that she would not resist my desire, and she 
            agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is illegal
            for you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I 
            thought it a sin to have sexual intercourse with her and left her 
            though she was the dearest of all the people to me, and also I left 
            the gold I had given her. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, 
            please relieve us from the present calamity.' So, the rock shifted a 
            little more but still they could not get out from there."
          <p> The Prophet added, "Then the third man said, 'O Allah! I employed few 
            laborers and I paid them their wages with the exception of one man who
            did not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages and I got 
            much property thereby. (Then after some time) he came and said to me: 
            O Allah's slave! Pay me my wages. I said to him: All the camels, cows,
            sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O Allah's slave! Don't 
            mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd 
            and drove them away and left nothing. O Allah! If I did that for Your 
            Sake only, please relieve us from the present suffering.' So, that 
            rock shifted completely and they got out walking.

          <p> Narrated Abu Said:
          <p> Some of the companions of the Prophet went on a journey till they 
            reached some of the 'Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to 
            treat them as their guests but they refused. The chief of that tribe 
            was then bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and they tried 
            their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said (to the others),
            "Nothing has benefited him, will you go to the people who resided here
            at night, it may be that some of them might possess something (as 
            treatment)," They went to the group of the companions (of the Prophet 
            ) and said, "Our chief has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a 
            scorpion) and we have tried everything but he has not benefitted. Have
            you got anything (useful)?" One of them replied, "Yes, by Allah! I can
            recite a Ruqya, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I
            will not recite the Ruqya for you unless you fix for us some wages for
            it." They agrees to pay them a flock of sheep. One of them then went 
            and recited (Suratul-Fatiha): 'All the praises are for the Lord of the
            Worlds' and puffed over the chief who became all right as if he was 
            released from a chain, and got up and started walking, showing no 
            signs of sickness.
          <p> They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the 
            companions) then  suggested to divide their earnings among themselves,
            but the one who performed the recitation said, "Do not divide them 
            till we go to the Prophet and narrate the whole story to him, and wait
            for his order." So, they went to Allah's Apostle and narrated the 
            story. Allah's Apostle asked, "How did you come to know that 
            Surat-ul-Fatiha was recited as Ruqya?" Then he added, "You have done 
            the right thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for 
            me as well." The Prophet smiled thereupon.
