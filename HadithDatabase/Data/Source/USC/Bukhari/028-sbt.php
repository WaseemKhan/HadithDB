            I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah's Apostle assumed the Ihram for

            that they told Ibn 'Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, 
            saying "There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this 
            year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba."
            Ibn 'Umar said "We set out with Allah's Apostle and the non-believers 
            of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka'ba, and so the Prophet 
            slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved." Ibn 'Umar added, "I 
            make you witnesses that I have made 'Umra obligatory for me. And, 
            Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka'ba is clear, I will
            perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka'ba then 
            I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company." Ibn
            'Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for 
            a while and said, "The conditions of 'Umra and Hajj are similar and I 
            make you witnesses that I have made 'Umra and Hajj obligatory for 
            myself." So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr 
            (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, "I 
            will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the 
            day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both 'Umra and 
            Hajj)."

            Hajj and 'Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made

            then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of 
            them (i.e. Hajj and ('Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for 
            him and offered a Hadi.
