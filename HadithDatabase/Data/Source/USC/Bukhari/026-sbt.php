          <p> Allah's Apostle used to go (for Hajj) via Ash-Shajara way and return 
            via Muarras way; and no doubt, whenever Allah's Apostle went to Mecca,
            he used to offer the prayer in the Mosque of Ash-Shajara; and on his 
            return, he used to offer the prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa in the middle of 
            the valley, and pass the night there till morning.

            where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the

            necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the
            25th of Dhul-Qa'da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja
            he performed the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and performed the Tawaf between
            Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did 
            not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca
            near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go 
            near the Ka'ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned 
            from 'Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf 
            round the Ka'ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short
            the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only

            could not perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba." So when it was the night of 
            Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, 'O Allah's 
            Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and 'Umra but I 
            am returning after performing Hajj only.' He said, 'Didn't you perform
            Tawaf round the Ka'ba the night we reached Mecca?' I replied in the

            Ihram for'Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a
            place.' On that Safiya said, 'I feel that I will detain you all.' The

            the day of sacrifice? (i.e. Tawaf-al-ifada) Safiya replied in the

            the Prophet met me while he was ascending (from Mecca) and I was

            Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, "Here

            Hajj and 'Umra together). And then 'Umar did the same. Then 'Uthman

            Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of 
            Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka'ba or performs 'Umra, 
            it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and 
            Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there 
            is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." 
            'Aisha said, "O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this 
            interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should 
            have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf 
            between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed 
            concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol
            called "Manat" which they used to worship at a place called 
            Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram 
            (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between 
            Safa and Marwa. 
          <p> When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) 
            regarding it, saying, "O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from 
            Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the 
            mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' " 
            Aisha added, "Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf 
            between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between
            them." Later on I ('Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin 'Abdur-Rahman (of 'Aisha's
            narration) and he said, 'i have not heard of such information, but I 
            heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom 'Aisha
            mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to 
            perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. 
          <p> When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka'ba and did not mention Safa
            and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! We used 
            to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the 
            verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka'ba and has not mentioned Safa and 
            Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' 
            So Allah revealed: "Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols 
            of Allah." Abu Bakr said, "It seems that this verse was revealed 
            concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf 
            between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and 
            those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam 
            they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf
            of the Ka'ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later

            poured water for his ablution. He performed light ablution and then I 
            said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah's Apostle!" He 
            replied, "The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at 
            Al-Muzdalifa)." So Allah's Apostle rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa 
            and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th 
            Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin Abbas) rode behind Allah's Apostle. Kuraib, 
            (a sub-narrator) said that 'Abdullah bin Abbas narrated from Al-Fadl, 
            "Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) kept on reciting Talbiya (during the

            Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not 
            (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka'ba and the 
            Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his 
            Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a 
            Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast 
            for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. 
            The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he
            touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast
            walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds 
            round the Ka'ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After 
            finishing Tawaf of the Ka'ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam 
            Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and 
            performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed 
            forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his
            Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of 
            Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf 
            of the Ka'ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram 
            became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did
