            youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old
            men. The Prophet asked, "O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the

          <p> Anas bin Malik said, that once a domestic sheep was milked for Allah's
            Apostle while he was in the house of Anas bin Malik. The milk was 
            mixed with water drawn from the well in Anas's house. A tumbler of it 
            was presented to Allah's Apostle who drank from it. Then Abu Bakr was 
            sitting on his left side and a bedouin on his right side. When the 
            Prophet removed the tumbler from his mouth, 'Umar was afraid that the 
            Prophet might give it to the bedouin, so he said. "O Allah's Apostle! 
            Give it to Abu Bakr who is sitting by your side." But the Prophet gave

            with the one on your right side."

            his property will meet Allah while He will be angry with him." Allah 
            revealed: 'Verily those who purchase a little gain at the cost of 
            Allah's covenant, and their oaths.' ........(3.77)

            "What has Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (i.e. Abdullah) been telling you? This 
            verse was revealed concerning me. I had a well in the land of a cousin
            of mine. The Prophet asked me to bring witnesses (to confirm my 
            claim). I said, 'I don't have witnesses.' He said, 'Let the defendant 
            take an oath then.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! He will take a (false)
            oath immediately.' Then the Prophet mentioned the above narration and 
            Allah revealed the verse to confirm what he had said." (See

            look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs
            shall be a severe punishment. They are:
          <p> 1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he withheld it from
            travelers.
          <p> 2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it 
            only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets 
            satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets 
            dissatisfied.
          <p> 3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the 'Asr prayer and he 
            said, 'By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I 
            have been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and 
            buys them)."

            about the Harra Canals which were used for irrigating the date-palms. 
            The Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, "Let the water pass' but Az-Zubair

            and he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the

            reward is the one who keeps it in Allah's Cause (prepare it for holy 
            battles) and ties it by a long rope in a pasture (or a garden). He 
            will get a reward equal to what its long rope allows it to eat in the 
            pasture or the garden, and if that horse breaks its rope and crosses 
            one or two hills, then all its foot-steps and its dung will be counted
            as good deeds for its owner; and if it passes by a river and drinks 
            from it, then that will also be regarded as a good deed for its owner

            shelter from poverty to the second person who keeps horses for earning
            his living so as not to ask others, and at the same time he gives 
            Allah's right (i.e. Rakat) (from the wealth he earns through using 
            them in trading etc.,) and does not overburden them. He who keeps 
            horses just out of pride and for showing off and as a means of harming
