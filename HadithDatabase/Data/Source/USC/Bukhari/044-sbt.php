        <p> "Allah's Apostle sent an army towards the east coast and appointed Abu
          'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of 
          three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a 
          place where our food was about to finish. Abu- 'Ubaida ordered us to 
          collect all the journey food and it was collected. My (our) journey 
          food was dates. Abu 'Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in 
          small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of
          us used to be one date only." I said, "How could one date benefit 
          you?" Jabir replied, "We came to know its value when even that too 
          finished." Jabir added, "When we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge 
          fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate from it for 
          eighteen days. Then Abu 'Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed 
          and they were fixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be
          ridden and it passed under the two ribs (forming an arch) without 
          touching them."

        <p> Once the journey food diminished and the people were reduced to 
          poverty. They went to the Prophet and asked his permission to 
          slaughter their camels, and he agreed. 'Umar met them and they told 
          him about it, and he said, "How would you survive after slaughtering 
          your camels?" Then he went to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's 
          Apostle! How would they survive after slaughtering their camels?" 
          Allah's Apostle ordered 'Umar, "Call upon the people to bring what has
          remained of their food." A leather sheet was spread and al I the 
          journey food was collected and heaped over it. Allah's Apostle stood 
          up and invoked Allah to bless it, and then directed all the people to 
          come with their utensils, and they started taking from it till all of 
          them got what was sufficient for them. Allah's Apostle then said, "I 
          testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am 
          His Apostle. "

          short, they would collect all their remaining food in one sheet and

          Dhul-Hulaifa. The people felt hungry and captured some camels and 
          sheep (as booty). The Prophet was behind the people. They hurried and 
          slaughtered the animals and put their meat in pots and started cooking
          it. (When the Prophet came) he ordered the pots to be upset and then 
          he distributed the animals (of the booty), regarding ten sheep as 
          equal to one camel. One of the camels fled and the people ran after it
          till they were exhausted. At that time there were few horses. A man 
          threw an arrow at the camel, and Allah stopped the camel with it. The 
          Prophet said, "Some of these animals are like wild animals, so if you 
          lose control over one of these animals, treat it in this way (i.e. 
          shoot it with an arrow)." Before distributing them among the soldiers 
          my grandfather said, "We may meet the enemies in the future and have 
          no knives; can we slaughter the animals with reeds?" The Prophet said,
          "Use whatever causes blood to flow, and eat the animals if the name of
          Allah has been mentioned on slaughtering them. Do not slaughter with 
          teeth or fingernails and I will tell you why: It is because teeth are 
          bones (i.e. cannot cut properly) and fingernails are the tools used by
          the Ethiopians (whom we should not imitate for they are infidels)."

          example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some
          of them got seats in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When
          the latter needed water, they had to go up to bring water (and that 
          troubled the others), so they said, 'Let us make a hole in our share 
          of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from 
          troubling them. So, if the people in the upper part left the others do
          what they had suggested, all the people of the ship would be

        <p> Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:
        <p> That he had asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the Statement of Allah: 
          "If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan
          girls, then Marry (Other) women of your choice Two or three or four." 
          (4.3)
        <p> She said, "O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl who lives with 
          her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt 
          him to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) 
          which might have been given by another suitor. So, such guardians were
          forbidden to marry such orphan girls unless they treated them justly 
          and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were ordered to 
          marry any other woman." 'Aisha further said, "After that verse the 
          people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan 
          'girls), so Allah revealed the following verses:-- 'They ask your 
          instruction Concerning the women. Say: Allah Instructs you about them 
          And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The orphan 
          girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you 
          Desire to marry..."  (4.127)
        <p> What is meant by Allah's Saying:-- 'And about what is Recited unto you
          is the former verse which goes:-- 'If you fear that you shall not Be 
          able to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of
          your choice.' (4.3) 'Aisha said, "Allah's saying in the other 
          verse:--'Yet whom you desire to marry' (4.127) means the desire of the
          guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision when she has 
          not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her 
          justly). The guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls 
          possessing property and beauty without being just to them, as they 
          generally refrain from marrying them (when they are neither beautiful 
          nor wealthy)."

        <p> Narrated 'Uqba bin 'Amir:
        <p> that Allah's Apostle gave him some sheep to distribute among his 
          companions in order to sacrifice them and a kid was left. He told the 
          Prophet about it and the Prophet said to him, "Sacrifice it on your 
          behalf."

        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin Hisham:
        <p> that his mother Zainab bint Humaid took him to the Prophet and said, 
          "O Allah's Apostle! Take the pledge of allegiance from him." But he 
          said, "He is still too young for the pledge," and passed his hand on 
          his (i.e. 'Abdullah's) head and invoked for Allah's blessing for him. 
          Zuhra bin Ma'bad stated that he used to go with his grandfather, 
          'Abdullah bin Hisham, to the market to buy foodstuff. Ibn 'Umar and 
          Ibn Az-Zubair would meet him and say to him, "Be our partner, as the 
          Prophet invoked Allah to bless you." So, he would be their partner, 
          and very often he would win a camel's load and send it home.

        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
        <p> The Prophet said, "Whoever manumits his share o a jointly possessed 
          slave, it is imperative on him to manumit the slave completely if he 
          has sufficient money to pay the rest of its price which is to be 
          estimated justly. He should pay his partners their shares and release 
          him (the freed one).

        <p> The Prophet said, "Whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed 
          slave, it is essential for him to manumit the slave completely if he 
          has sufficient money. Otherwise he should look for some work for the 
          slave (to earn what would enable him to emancipate himself), without 
          overburdening him with work."

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:
        <p> The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in the morning 
          of the fourth of Dhul-Hijja assuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we 
          arrived at Mecca, the Prophet ordered us to change our intentions of 
          the Ihram for'Umra and that we could finish our Ihram after performing
          the 'Umra and could go to our wives (for sexual intercourse). The 
          people began talking about that. Jabir said surprisingly, "Shall we go
          to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?" Jabir moved 
          his hand while saying so. When this news reached the Prophet he 
          delivered a sermon and said, "I have been informed that some peoples 
          were saying so and so; By Allah I fear Allah more than you do, and am 
          more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would
          not have brought the Hadi (sacrifice) with me and had the Hadi not 
          been with me, I would have finished the Ihram." At that Suraqa bin 
          Malik stood up and asked "O Allah's Apostle! Is this permission for us
          only or is it forever?" The Prophet replied, "It is forever." In the 
          meantime 'Ali bin Abu Talib came from Yemen and was saying Labbaik for
          what the Prophet has intended. (According to another man, 'Ali was 
          saying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Allah's Apostle's). The Prophet 
          told him to keep on the Ihram and let him share the Hadi with him.

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa:
        <p> My grandfather, Rafi bin Khadij said, "We were in the valley of 
          Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some 
          camels and sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering 
          the animals) and put their meat in the pots and started cooking. 
          Allah's Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots, and 
          distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One
          of the camels fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got 
          worried. (The camel was chased and) a man slopped the camel by 
          throwing an arrow at it. Allah's Apostle said, 'Some of these animals 
          are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your 
          control, then you should treat it as you have done now.' " My 
          grandfather said, "O Allah's Apostle! We fear that we may meet our 
          enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we slaughter the animals 
          with reeds?" The Prophet said, "Yes, or you can use what would make 
          blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the 
          Name of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don't use 
          teeth or fingernails (in slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for 
          teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used by Ethiopians for 
          slaughtering.  (See Hadith 668)
