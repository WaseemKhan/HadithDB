          believer is afflicted with calamities (but he remains patient till

          a pine tree which keeps hard and straight till Allah cuts (breaks) it

          informed Allah's Apostle about that, whereupon he said, "O Allah! Make
          us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca. O Allah! Make it 
          healthy and bless its Mudd and Sa for us, and take away its fever and

        <p> Narrated Usama bin Zaid:
        <p> The Prophet rode a donkey having a saddle with a Fadakiyya velvet 
          covering. He mounted me behind him and went to visit Sad bin 'Ubada, 
          and that had been before the battle of Badr. The Prophet proceeded 
          till he passed by a gathering in which 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul 
          was present, and that had been before 'Abdullah embraced Islam. The 
          gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e., isolators and Jews.
          'Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust 
          raised by the donkey covered the gathering, 'Abdullah bin Ubai covered
          his nose with his upper garment and said, "Do not trouble us with 
          dust." The Prophet greeted them, stopped and dismounted. Then he 
          invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them 
          some verses of the Holy Qur'an. On that, 'Abdullah bin Ubai said, "O 
          man ! There is nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not 
          trouble us with it in our gathering, but return to your house, and if 
          somebody comes to you, teach him there." On that 'Abdullah bin Rawaha 
          said, Yes, O Allah's Apostle! Bring your teachings to our gathering, 
          for we love that." So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started 
          abusing each other till they were about to fight. The Prophet kept on 
          quietening them till they became calm. Thereupon the Prophet mounted 
          his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. He said 
          to him "O Sad! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e., 'Abdullah bin 
          Ubai) said?" Sad said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for
          Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town 
          (Medina decided unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by 
          placing a turban on his head, but when that was prevented by the Truth
          which Allah had given you he ('Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved out of 
          jealously, and that was the reason which caused him to behave in the 
          way you have seen."
