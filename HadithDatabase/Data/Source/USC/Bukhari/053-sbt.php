        <h1> <em> One-fifth of Booty to the Cause of Allah (Khumus) </em> </h1>
        <hr>
        <p> <em> <a name="004.053.324"> Volume 4, Book 53, Number 324: </a> </em>
        <blockquote>
          <p> Narrated Ali:
          <p> I got a she-camel in my share of the war booty on the day (of the 
            battle) of Badr, and the Prophet had given me a she-camel from the 
            Khumus. When I intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Allah's 
            Apostle, I had an appointment with a goldsmith from the tribe of Bani 
            Qainuqa' to go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. grass of pleasant smell)
            and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding party.
            I was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and 
            ropes while my two she-camels were kneeling down beside the room of an
            Ansari man. I returned after collecting whatever I collected, to see 
            the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their flanks cut open and 
            some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of 
            my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, "Who has done 
            this?" The people replied, "Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib who is staying 
            with some Ansari drunks in this house." I went away till I reached the
            Prophet and Zaid bin Haritha was with him. The Prophet noticed on my 
            face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet asked. "What is
            wrong with you." I replied, "O Allah's Apostle! I have never seen such
            a day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps,
            and ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting there in a house in 
            the company of some drunks." The Prophet then asked for his covering 
            sheet, put it on, and set out walking followed by me and Zaid bin 
            Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He asked permission
            to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah's Apostle 
            started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and 
            his eyes were red. Hamza looked at Allah's Apostle and then he raised 
            his eyes, looking at his knees, then he raised up his eyes looking at 
            his umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at his face. 
            Hamza then said, "Aren't you but the slaves of my father?" Allah's 
            Apostle realized that he was drunk, so Allah's Apostle retreated, and 
            we went out with him.

        <blockquote>
          <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
          <p> (mother of the believers) After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima  
            the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, 
            her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had left of the Fai
            (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu 
            Bakr said to her, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be 
            inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for
            charity)." Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle got angry and 
            stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude 
            till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of
            Allah's Apostle.
          <p> She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of Allah's 
            Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at 
            Medina (devoted for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that 
            property and said, "I will not leave anything Allah's Apostle  used to
            do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the Prophet's 
            tradition, then I would go astray." (Later on) Umar gave the Prophet's
            property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to 'Ali and 'Abbas, but he withheld the
            properties of Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, "These two 
            properties are the Sadaqa which Allah's Apostle used to use for his 
            expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is to be entrusted
            to the ruler." (Az-Zuhrl said, "They have been managed in this way 
            till today.")

        <blockquote>
          <p> Narrated Malik bin Aus:
          <p> While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the 
            messenger of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and said, "The chief of 
            the believers has sent for you." So, I went along with him till I 
            entered the place where 'Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of 
            date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and he was leaning over
            a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, "O Malik! Some 
            persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered
            that a gift should be given to them, so take it and distribute it 
            among them." I said, "O chief of the believers! I wish that you order 
            someone else to do it." He said, "O man! Take it." While I was sitting
            there with him, his doorman Yarfa' came saying, "'Uthman, 
            'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf, Az-Zubair and Sad bin Abi Waqqas are asking 
            your permission (to see you); may I admit them?" 'Umar said, "Yes", So
            they were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After 
            a while Yarfa' came again and said, "May I admit 'Ali and 'Abbas?" 
            'Umar said, "yes." So, they were admitted and they came in and greeted
            (him) and sat down. Then 'Abbas said, "O chief of the believers! Judge
            between me and this (i.e. 'Ali)." They had a dispute regarding the 
            property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai.
            The group (i.e. 'Uthman and his companions) said, "O chief of the 
            believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them front each 
            other." 'Umar said, "Be patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose 
            Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you know that Allah's 
            Apostle said, 'Our (i.e. prophets') property will not be inherited, 
            and whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),' and 
            Allah's Apostle meant himself (by saying "we'')?" The group said, "He 
            said so." 'Umar then turned to 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, "I beseech 
            you by Allah, do you know that Allah's Apostle said so?" They replied,
            " He said so." 'Umar then said, "So, I will talk to you about this 
            matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of 
            something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else." 'Umar 
            then recited the Holy Verses: "What Allah bestowed as (Fai) Booty on 
            his Apostle (Muhammad) from them --- for this you made no expedition 
            with either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power to His Apostles 
            over whomever He will 'And Allah is able to do all things."   9:6)
          <p> 'Umar added "So this property was especially given to Allah's Apostle,
            but, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, 
            nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to 
            all of you and distributed it amongst you till this property remained 
            out of it. Allah's Apostle used to spend the yearly expenses of his 
            family out of this property and used to keep the rest of its revenue 
            to be spent on Allah 's Cause. Allah 's Apostle kept on doing this 
            during all his lifetime. I ask you by Allah do you know this?" They 
            replies in the affirmative. 'Umar then said to 'Ali and 'Abbas. "I ask
            you by Allah, do you know this?" 'Umar added, "When Allah had taken 
            His Prophet unto Him, 'Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's 
            Apostle so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the 
            same way as Allah's Apostle used to do, and Allah knows that he was 
            true, pious and rightly-guided, and he was a follower of what was 
            right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr's 
            successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first two
            years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah's Apostle 
            used to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have 
            been true, pious, rightly guided, and a follower of what is right. Now
            you both (i.e. 'Ah and 'Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same 
            claim and presenting the same case; you, 'Abbas, came to me asking for
            your share from your nephew's property, and this man, i.e. 'Ali, came 
            to me asking for his wife's share from her father's property. I told 
            you both that Allah's Apostle said, 'Our (prophets') properties are 
            not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used for 
            charity).' When I thought it right that I should hand over this 
            property to you, I said to you, 'I am ready to hand over this property
            to you if you wish, on the condition that you would take Allah's 
            Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way as 
            Allah's Apostle used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have 
            done since I was in charge of it.' So, both of you said (to me), 'Hand
            it over to us,' and on that condition I handed it over to you. So, I 
            ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this condition?" The 
            group aid, "Yes." Then 'Umar faced 'Ali and Abbas saying, "I ask you 
            by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?" They said, 
            "Yes. " He said, " Do you want now to give a different decision? By 
            Allah, by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will 
            never give any decision other than that (I have already given). And if
            you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the 
            job on your behalf."

          <p> Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:
          <p> The delegates of the tribe of 'Abdul-Qais came and said, "O Allah's

            instructions that we may apply it to ourselves and also invite our 
            people whom we left behind us to observe as well." The Prophet said, 
            "I order you (to do) four (things) and forbid you (to do) four: I 
            order you to believe in Allah, that is, to testify that None has the 
            right to be worshipped but Allah (the Prophet pointed with his hand); 
            to offer prayers perfectly; to pay Zakat; to fast the month of

            married a woman and wants to consummate the marriage, and has not done
            so yet, should not accompany me; nor should a man who has built a 
            house but has not completed its roof; nor a man who has sheep or 
            shecamels and is waiting for the birth of their young ones.' So, the 
            prophet carried out the expedition and when he reached that town at 
            the time or nearly at the time of the 'Asr prayer, he said to the sun,
            'O sun! You are under Allah's Order and I am under Allah's Order O 
            Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.' It was stopped till Allah
            made him victorious.
          <p> Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it, but it did 
            not burn it. He said (to his men), 'Some of you have stolen something 
            from the booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a pledge of
            allegiance by shaking hands with me.' (They did so and) the hand of a 
            man got stuck over the hand of their prophet. Then that prophet said 
            (to the man), 'The theft has been committed by your people. So all the
            persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by 
            shaking hands with me.' The hands of two or three men got stuck over 
            the hand of their prophet and he said, "You have committed the theft.'
            Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a cow and put it 
            there, and the fire came and consumed the booty. The Prophet added:

          <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair:
          <p> When Az-Zubair got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he called me and 
            I stood up beside him, and he said to me, "O my son! Today one will be
            killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I 
            will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do 
            you think, if we pay the debts, there will be something left for us 
            from our money?" Az-Zubair added, "O my son! Sell our property and pay
            my debts." Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and willed 
            one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, 'Abdullah's sons. He 
            said, "One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the 
            payment of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is 
            to be given to your sons." (Hisham, a sub-narrator added, "Some of the
            sons of 'Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair e.g. 
            Khubaib and 'Abbas. 'Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that
            time." (The narrator 'Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on 
            drawing my attention to his debts saying, "If you should fail to pay 
            part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you." By Allah! I could
            not understand what he meant till I asked, "O father! Who is your 
            Master?" He replied, "Allah (is my Master)." By Allah, whenever I had 
            any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say, "Master of Az-Zubair!
            Pay his debts on his behalf ." and Allah would (help me to) pay it. 
            Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of 
            land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina,
            two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the
            debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought some money to deposit
            with him. Az Zubair would say, "No, (i won't keep it as a trust), but 
            I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost." Az-Zubair was 
            never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any 
            other similar thing, but he collected his wealth (from the war booty 
            he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of 
            the Prophet, Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman. ('Abdullah bin Az-Zubair 
            added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two 
            hundred thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam met 
            Abdullah bin Zubair and asked, "O my nephew! How much is the debt of 
            my brother?" 'Abdullah kept it as a secret and said, "One hundred 
            thousand," Hakim said, "By Allah! I don't think your property will 
            cover it." On that 'Abdullah said to him, "What if it is two million 
            and two hundred thousand?" Hakim said, "I don't think you can pay it; 
            so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you." Az-Zubair had
            already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. 
            'Abdullah sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he 
            called the people saying, "Any person who has any money claim on 
            Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba." There came to him 'Abdullah 
            bin Ja'far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to 
            'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, "If you wish I will forgive you the debt." 
            'Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said, "No." Then Ibn Ja'far said, "If you 
            wish you can defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any 
            debt." Ibn Az-Zubair said, "No." 'Abdullah bin Ja'far said, "Give me a
            piece of the land." 'Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to him), "Yours is 
            the land extending from this place to this place." So, 'Abdullah bin 
            Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid 
            his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land 
            (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu'awlya while 'Amr bin 'Uthman, 
            Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam'a were sitting with him. Mu'awiya
            asked, "At what price have you appraised Al-Ghaba?" He said, "One 
            hundred thousand for each share," Muawiya asked, "How many shares have
            been left?" 'Abdullah replied, "Four and a half shares." Al-Mundhir 
            bin Az-Zubair said, "I would like to buy one share for one hundred 
            thousand." 'Amr bin 'Uthman said, "I would like to buy one share for 
            one hundred thousand." Ibn Zam'a said, "I would like to buy one share 
            for one hundred thousand." Muawiya said, "How much is left now?" 
            'Abdullah replied, "One share and a half." Muawiya said, "I would like
            to buy it for one hundred and fifty thousand." 'Abdullah also sold his
            part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn AzZubair had paid all 
            the debts. Az-Zubair's sons said to him, "Distribute our inheritance 
            among us." He said, "No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among you 
            till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, 'Would those who have
            money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt." 
            So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and 
            when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the 
            inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his 
            property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives 
            received one million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of 
            his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand.

            said. 'O Allah's Apostles We have agreed willingly to do so (return 
            the captives)" Then Allah's Apostle said to them "I do not know who

          <p> Narrated Abu Qatada:
          <p> We set out in the company of Allah's Apostle on the day (of the 
            battle) of Hunain. When we faced the enemy, the Muslims retreated and 
            I saw a pagan throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around and came
            upon him from behind and hit him on the shoulder with the sword He 
            (i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so violently that I 
            felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he 
            released me. I followed 'Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), "What is
            wrong with the people (fleeing)?" He replied, "This is the Will of 
            Allah," After the people returned, the Prophet sat and said, "Anyone 
            who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will posses his 
            spoils." I got up and said, "Who will be a witness for me?" and then 
            sat down. The Prophet again said, "Anyone who has killed an enemy and 
            has proof of that, will possess his spoils." I (again) got up and 
            said, "Who will be a witness for me?" and sat down. Then the Prophet 
            said the same for the third time. I again got up, and Allah's Apostle 
            said, "O Abu Qatada! What is your story?" Then I narrated the whole 
            story to him. A man (got up and) said, "O Allah's Apostle! He is 
            speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me. So 
            please compensate him on my behalf." On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 
            "No, by Allah, he (i.e. Allah's Apostle ) will not agree to give you 
            the spoils gained by one of Allah's Lions who fights on the behalf of 
            Allah and His Apostle." The Prophet said, "Abu Bakr has spoken the 
            truth." So, Allah's Apostle gave the spoils to me. I sold that armor 
            (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima,
            and this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to 
            Islam.

          <p> Hakim bin Hizam said, "I asked Allah's Apostle for something, and he 
            gave me. I asked him again, and he gave me, and said to me. 'O Hakim! 
            This wealth is like green sweet (i.e. fruit), and if one takes it 
            without greed, then one is blessed in it, and if one takes it with 
            greediness, then one is not blessed in it, and will be like the one 
            who eats without satisfaction. And an upper (i.e. giving) hand is 
            better than a lower (i.e. taking) hand,' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! 
            By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I will not ask anyone for 
            anything after you till I leave this world." So, when Abu Bakr during 
            his Caliphate, called Hakim to give him (some money), Hakim refused to
            accept anything from him. Once 'Umar called him (during his Caliphate)
            in order to give him something, but Hakim refused to accept it, 
            whereupon 'Umar said, "O Muslims! I give him (i.e. Haklm) his right 
            which Allah has assigned to him) from this Fai '(booty), but he 
            refuses to take it." So Haklm never took anything from anybody after 
            the Prophet till he died.

            the attack and) An-Nu' man said to Al-Mughira, "If you had 
            participated in a similar battle, in the company of Allah's Apostle he
            would not have blamed you for waiting, nor would he have disgraced 
            you. But I accompanied Allah's Apostle in many battles and it was his 
            custom that if he did not fight early by daytime, he would wait till 
            the wind had started blowing and the time for the prayer was due (i.e.
            after midday)."

            would give you this much and this much." When Allah's Apostle had 
            died, the revenue of Bahrain came, and Abu Bakr announced, " Let 
            whoever was promised something by Allah's Apostle come to me." So, I 
            went to Abu Bakr and said, "Allah's Apostle said to me, 'If the 
            revenue of Bahrain came, I would give you this much and this. much." 
            On that Abu Bakr said to me, "Scoop (money) with both your hands." I 
            scooped money with both my hands and Abu Bakr asked me to count it. I 
            counted it and it was five-hundred (gold pieces). The total amount he 
            gave me was one thousand and five hundred (gold pieces.)
          <p> Narrated Anas: Money from Bahrain was brought to the Prophet . He 
            said, "Spread it in the Mosque." It was the biggest amount that had 
            ever been brought to Allah's Apostle . In the meantime Al-'Abbas came 
            to him and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Give me, for I gave the ransom of
            myself and Aqil." The Prophet said (to him), "Take." He scooped money 
            with both hands and poured it in his garment and tried to lift it, but
            he could not and appealed to the Prophet, "Will you order someone to 
            help me in lifting it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-'Abbas said, 
            "Then will you yourself help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." 
            Then Al 'Abbas threw away some of the money, but even then he was not 
            able to lift it, and so he gain requested the Prophet "Will you order 
            someone to help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-'Abbas 
            said, "Then will you yourself yelp me carry it?" The Prophet said, 
            'No." So, Al-'Abbas threw away some more money and lifted it on his 
            shoulder and went away. The Prophet kept on looking at him with 
            astonishment at his greediness till he went out of our sight. Allah's 
            Apostle did not get up from there till not a single Dirham remained 
            from that money.

            true and truly inspired one (i.e. the Prophet)." The people asked, 
            "What does the Statement say?" He replied, "Allah and His Apostle's 
            asylum granted to Dhimmis, i.e. non-Muslims living in a Muslim 
            territory) will be outraged, and so Allah will make the hearts of 
            these Dhimmis so daring that they will refuse to pay the Jizya they 
            will be supposed to pay."

            Blame yourselves! We were with the Prophet on the day of Hudaibiya, 
            and if we had been called to fight, we would have fought. But 'Umar

          <p> On that Abu Bakr said (to 'Umar). 'He is the Apostle of Allah and 
            Allah will never degrade him.' Then Surat-al-Fath (i.e. Victory) was 
            revealed and Allah's Apostle recited it to the end in front of 'Umar. 
            On that 'Umar asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! Was it (i.e. the Hudaibiya

          <p> Narrated Al-Bara:
          <p> When the Prophet intended to perform the 'Umra he sent a person to the
            people of Mecca asking their permission to enter Mecca. They 
            stipulated that he would not stay for more than three days and would 
            not enter it except with sheathed arms and would not preach (Islam) to
            any of them. So Ali bin Abi-Talib started writing the treaty between 
            them. He wrote, "This is what Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has agreed 
            to." The (Meccans) said, "If we knew that you (Muhammad) are the 
            Apostle of Allah, then we would not have prevented you and would have 
            followed you. But write, 'This is what Muhammad bin 'Abdullah has 
            agreed to..' " On that Allah's Apostle said, "By Allah, I am Muhammad 
            bin 'Abdullah, and, by Allah, I am Apostle of 'Allah." Allah's Apostle
            used not to write; so he asked 'Ali to erase the expression of Apostle
            of Allah. On that 'Ali said, "By Allah I will never erase it." Allah's
            Apostle said (to 'Ali), "Let me see the paper." When 'Ali showed him 
            the paper, the Prophet erased the expression with his own hand. When 
            Allah's Apostle had entered Mecca and three days had elapsed, the 
            Meccans came to 'Ali and said, "Let your friend (i.e. the Prophet) 
            quit Mecca." Ali informed Allah's Apostle about it and Allah's Apostle
            said, "Yes," and then he departed.

            back, and invoked evil on whoever had done (the evil deed). The
