        <p> Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:
        <p> I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "The reward of deeds depends upon the 
          intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he 
          has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman
          to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for."

        <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
        <p> (the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked 
          Allah's Apostle "O Allah's Apostle! How is the Divine Inspiration 
          revealed to you?" Allah's Apostle replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed)
          like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of
          all and then this state passes ' off after I have grasped what is 
          inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to 
          me and I grasp whatever he says." 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the 
          Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the 
          Sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).
        <p>        
      </blockquote>
      <hr>
      <em> <a name="001.001.003"> Volume 1, Book 1, Number 3: </a> </em>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
        <p> (the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine 
          Inspiration to Allah's Apostle was in the form of good dreams which 
          came true like bright day light, and then the love of seclusion was 
          bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira 
          where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days 
          before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the 
          journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to 
          take his food like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon 
          him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked 
          him to read. The Prophet replied, "I do not know how to read.
        <p> The Prophet added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so
          hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again 
          asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon
          he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear 
          it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again 
          I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' 
          Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then 
          released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created 
          (all that exists) has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is 
          the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Apostle returned 
          with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went
          to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered
          him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that 
          had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." 
          Khadija replied, "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You 
          keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the poor and the 
          destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving 
          calamity-afflicted ones."
        <p> Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad 
          bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the PreIslamic Period became a Christian
          and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from
          the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an 
          old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to 
          the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! 
          What have you seen?" Allah's Apostle described whatever he had seen. 
          Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel 
          Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could 
          live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's 
          Apostle asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the 
          affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to
          what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should 
          remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would 
          support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine
          Inspiration was also paused for a while.
        <p> Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari while talking about the period 
          of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet "While I 
          was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up
          and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira' sitting
          on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came
          back home and said, 'Wrap me (in blankets).' And then Allah revealed 
          the following Holy Verses (of Quran):
        <p> 'O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in garments!' Arise and warn (the 
          people against Allah's Punishment),... up to 'and desert the idols.' 
          (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently
          and regularly."

      <em> <a name="001.001.004"> Volume 1, Book 1, Number 4: </a> </em>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Said bin Jubair:
        <p> Ibn 'Abbas in the explanation of the Statement of Allah. 'Move not 
          your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith." (75.16) 
          Said "Allah's Apostle used to bear the revelation with great trouble 
          and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration." Ibn 'Abbas 
          moved his lips saying, "I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah's
          Apostle used to move his." Said moved his lips saying: "I am moving my
          lips, as I saw Ibn 'Abbas moving his." Ibn 'Abbas added, "So Allah 
          revealed 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste 
          therewith. It is for us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the
          ability to recite it (the Qur'an) (75.16-17) which means that Allah 
          will make him (the Prophet ) remember the portion of the Qur'an which 
          was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The Statement of 
          Allah: And 'When we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through 
          Gabriel) then you follow its (Qur'an) recital' (75.18) means 'listen 
          to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Allah) to make It clear to 
          you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and 
          its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, 
          Allah's Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after 
          his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it."

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:
        <p> Allah's Apostle was the most generous of all the people, and he used 
          to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel 
          met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him 
          the Qur'an. Allah's Apostle was the most generous person, even more 
          generous than the strong uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste 
          to do charitable deeds).

      <hr>
      <em> <a name="001.001.006"> Volume 1, Book 1, Number 6: </a> </em>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:
        <p> Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to
          him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were 
          merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and 
          Jordan), at the time when Allah's Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan 
          and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to 
          Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and 
          he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his 
          translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, "Who 
          amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a 
          Prophet?" Abu Sufyan replied, "I am the nearest relative to him 
          (amongst the group)."
        <p> Heraclius said, "Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his 
          companions stand behind him." Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his 
          translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions 
          to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they 
          (my companions) should contradict me." Abu Sufyan added, "By Allah! 
          Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not
          have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked 
          me about him was:
        <p> 'What is his family status amongst you?' 
        <p> I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.' 
        <p> Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the 
          same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'
        <p> I replied, 'No.'
        <p> He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'
        <p> I replied, 'No.'
        <p> Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'
        <p> I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'
        <p> He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'
        <p> I replied, 'They are increasing.'
        <p> He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion 
          become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'
        <p> I replied, 'No.'
        <p> Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his 
          claim (to be a Prophet)?'
        <p> I replied, 'No. '
        <p> Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'
        <p> I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he 
          will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against 
          him except that.
        <p> Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'
        <p> I replied, 'Yes.'
        <p> Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'
        <p> I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'
        <p> Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'
        <p> I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to 
          worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our 
          ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be 
          chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'
        <p> Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked 
          you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very 
          noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families 
          amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody 
          else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.
          If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that 
          this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you 
          whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the 
          negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought 
          that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.
        <p> I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he 
          said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered 
          how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a 
          lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed 
          him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. 
          And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of 
          people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or 
          decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is
          the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further 
          asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his 
          religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was
          in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when 
          its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked 
          you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and 
          likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered 
          you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah 
          alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to 
          worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be 
          chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this 
          place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he 
          was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and 
          if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him 
          and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius 
          then asked for the letter addressed by Allah's Apostle
        <p> which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded 
          it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: 
          "In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) 
          from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the 
          ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. 
          Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will
          be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this 
          invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your 
          Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah's Statement:)
        <p> 'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that 
          we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship 
          with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.
          Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those 
          who have surrendered to Allah).' (3:64).
        <p> Abu Sufyan then added, "When Heraclius had finished his speech and had
          read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So 
          we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the 
          question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so 
          prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of
          him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the 
          conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided 
          me to it)."
        <p> The sub narrator adds, "Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya' 
          (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn 
          An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya' 
          (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his 
          priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller 
          and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I
          saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared 
          (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The 
          people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you
          should not be afraid of them (Jews).
        <p> 'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'
        <p> While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan
          to convey the news of Allah's Apostle to Heraclius was brought in. 
          Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see
          whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after 
          seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then 
          asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice
          circumcision.'
        <p> (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs
          had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who 
          was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. 
          (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his 
          letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the 
          emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that 
          Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his 
          palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of 
          his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If 
          success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your 
          empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet 
          (i.e. embrace Islam).'
        <p> (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates 
          of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius 
          realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their
          embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in 
          audience.
        <p> (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the 
          strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated
          before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of 
          Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).
        <p>
