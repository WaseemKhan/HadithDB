            'Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some 
            people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer

            times the Prophet had performed 'Umra. He replied, 'Four times; one of
            them was in the month of Rajab." We disliked to contradict him. Then 
            we heard 'Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth 
            with Siwak in the dwelling place. 'Ursa said, "O Mother! O Mother of 
            the believers! Don't you hear what Abu 'Abdur Rahman is saying?" She 
            said, "What does he say?" 'Ursa said, "He says that Allah's Apostle 
            performed four 'Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab." 
            'Aisha said, "May Allah be merciful to Abu 'Abdur Rahman! The Prophet 
            did not perform any 'Umra except that he was with him, and he never 
            performed any 'Umra in Rajab."

            pagans hindered him; 2. 'Umra in the following year in Dhi-l-Qa'da 
            after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. 'Umra from 
            Al-Jr'rana where he distributed the war booty." I think he meant the 
            booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, "How many times did he

            Hasba, he sent 'Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan'im and I assumed Ihram

          <p> Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:
          <p> The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except 
            the Prophet and Talha had the Hadi with them. 'Ali had come from Yemen
            and he had the Hadi with him. He ('Ali) said, "I have assumed Ihram 
            with an intention like that of Allah's Apostle has assumed it." The 
            Prophet ordered his companions to intend the Ihram with which they had
            come for 'Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba (and between Safa 
            and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram
            with the exception of those who had the Hadi with them. They asked, 
            "Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are 
            dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our 
            wives)?" The Prophet heard that and said, "Had I known what I know 
            now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I did not have the Hadi 
            with me I would have finished my Ihram." 'Aisha got her menses and 
            performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she 
            became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the 
            Ka'ba, she said, "O Allah's Apostle! You (people) are returning with 
            both Hajj and 'Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!" So, he ordered
            'Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to At-Tan'im. Thus she 
            performed 'Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin
            Malik bin Ju'sham met the Prophet at Al-'Aqaba (Jamrat-ul 'Aqaba) 
            while the latter was stoning it and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Is this 
            permissible only for you?" The Prophet replied, "No, it is for ever 
            (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform 'Umra before 
            Hajj."

          <p> The sub-narrator adds: He ('AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And 
            she assumed Ihram for 'Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha

          <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
          <p> We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards 
            the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet 
            said to his companions, "Whoever has not got the Hadi with him and 
            likes to make it as 'Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the 
            Hadi with him should not do it." The Prophet and some of his wealthy 
            companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish Ihram after 
            performing the 'Umra. The Prophet came to me while I was weeping. He 
            asked me the reason for it. I replied, "I have heard of what you have 
            said to your companions and I cannot do the 'Umra." He asked me, "What
            is the matter with you?" I replied, "I am not praying."  He said, 
            "There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and 
            the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj
            and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the 'Umra as well." 
            So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab.
            The Prophet called 'Abdur-Rahman and said, "Go out of the sanctuary 
            with your sister and let her assume Ihram for 'Umra, and after both of
            you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place." 
            We came back at mid-night and the Prophet asked us, "Have you 
            finished?" I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure 
            and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed 
            the Tawaf of the Ka'ba before the morning prayer, and after that the 
            Prophet set out for Medina.

          <p> Narrated Safwan bin Ya'la bin Umaiya from his father who said:
          <p> "A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji'rana. The man was 
            wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of 
            perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), 'What do you order me to 
            perform in my 'Umra?' So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he 
            was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being 
            divinely inspired. 'Umar said to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to 
            look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?' I replied in the 
            affirmative. 'Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the 
            Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The 
            snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the 
            Prophet asked, "Where is the questioner who asked about 'Umra? Put off
            your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean
            the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in 
            your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and the Sa'i between Safa 
            and Marwa). "

          <p> Narrated Hisham Ibn 'Urwa from his father who said:
          <p> While I was a youngster, I asked 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet. "What
            about the meaning of the Statement of Allah;
          <p> "Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols 
            of Allah. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or 'Umra of 
            the House (Ka'ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? 
            (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody 
            does not perform the Tawaf between them." 'Aisha replied, "No, for if 
            it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like 
            this: 'It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.' This 
            verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the
            Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid 
            and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-Safa 
            and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah's Apostle about that, 
            and Allah revealed:--
          <p> "Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of
            Allah. So, it is not harmful of those who perform Hajj or 'Umra of the
            House (Ka'ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them." 
            (2.158)  Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from 'Aisha): "The 
            Hajj or 'Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) 
            between As-Safa and Al-Marwa is incomplete in Allah's sight.

            too performed 'Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed
            the Tawaf (of Ka'ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then 
            he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we 
            also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the 
            people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow." A friend of his 
            asked him (i.e. 'Abdullah bin Aufa), "Did the Prophet enter the Ka'ba 
            (during that 'Umra)?" He replied in the negative. Then he said, "What 
            did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?" He (Abdullah bin Aufa) said,
            "(He said) 'Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace

            times and then offered a two Rak'at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and

            that of the Prophet. He said, "You have done well. Perform the Tawaf 
            of the Ka'ba and (the Sai) between As-safa and Al-Marwa and then

            tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram
            for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the 
            caliphate of 'Umar who said, "If you follow the Holy Book then it 
            orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj,
