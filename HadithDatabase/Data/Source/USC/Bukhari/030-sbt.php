            reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet 
            ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be 
            levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms 
            were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.

          <p> Narrated Anas:
          <p> Whenever the Prophet returned from a journey and observed the walls of
            Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal 
            (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for 
            Medina.

          <p> Narrated Anas:
          <p> (The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the 
            Prophet) but Allah's Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, 
            "O the people of Bani Salama! Don't you think that you will be 
            rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?" So, 
            they stayed at their old places.

        <blockquote>
          <p> Narrated 'Aisha:
          <p> When Allah's Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. 
            When Abu Bakr's fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): 
            "Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to 
            him than His shoe laces." And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, 
            would recite: "Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I
            would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling 
            grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and
            Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!" 
            The Prophet said, "O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi'a and 'Utba bin 
            Rabi'a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the 
            land of epidemics." Allah's Apostle then said, "O Allah! Make us love 
            Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give 
            blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make 
            the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards 
            Aljuhfa." Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most 
            unhealthy of Allah's lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of 
            Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.
