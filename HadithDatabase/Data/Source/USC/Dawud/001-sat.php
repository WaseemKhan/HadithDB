          <p> Narrated Laqit ibn Sabirah: </p>
          <p> I was the leader of the delegation of Banu al-Muntafiq or (the narrator doubted) I was among the delegation of Banu al-Muntafiq that came to the Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). When we reached the Prophet, we did not find him in his house. We found there Aisha, the Mother of the Believers. She ordered that a dish called Khazirah should be prepared for us. It was then prepared. A tray containing dates was then presented to us. (The narrator Qutaybah did not mention the word qina', tray). </p>
          <p> Then the Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came. He asked: Has anything been served to you or ordered for you?  We replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah. While we were sitting in the company of the Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) we suddenly saw that a shepherd was driving a herd of sheep to their fold. He had with him a newly-born lamb that was crying. </p>
          <p> He (the Prophet) asked him: What did it bear, O so and so? He replied: A ewe. He then said: Slaughter for us in its place a sheep. Do not think that we are slaughtering it for you. We have one hundred sheep and we do not want their number to increase. Whenever a ewe is born, we slaughter a sheep in its place. </p>
          <p> (The narrator says that the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) used the word la tahsabanna, do not think). </p>
          <p> I (the narrator Laqit) then said: Messenger of Allah, I have a wife who has something (wrong) in her tongue, i.e. she is insolent. He said: Then divorce her. I said: Messenger of Allah, she had company with me and I have children from her. He said: Then ask her (to obey you). If there is something good in her, she will do so (obey); and do not beat your wife as you beat your slave-girl. </p>
          <p> I said: Messenger of Allah, tell me about ablution. He said: Perform ablution in full and make the fingers go through the beard and snuff with water well except when you are fasting. </p>

The people were detained to make a search for that necklace until the dawn broke. There was no water with the people. Therefore AbuBakr became angry with her and said: You detained the people and they have no water with them. </p>
          <p> Thereupon Allah, the Exalted, sent down revelation about it to His Apostle (peace_be_upon_him) granting concession to purify themselves with pure earth. Then the Muslims stood up with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and struck the ground with their hands and then they raised their hands, and did not take any earth (in their hands). Then they wiped with them their faces and hands up to the shoulders, and from their palms up to the armpits. </p>

          <p> I had a sexual dream on a cold night in the battle of Dhat as-Salasil. I was afraid, if I washed I would die. I, therefore, performed tayammum and led my companions in the dawn prayer. They mentioned that to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). He said: Amr, you led your companions is prayer while you were sexually defiled? I informed him of the cause which impeded me from washing. And I said: I heard Allah say: "Do not kill yourself, verily Allah is merciful to you." The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) laughed and did not say anything. </p>
