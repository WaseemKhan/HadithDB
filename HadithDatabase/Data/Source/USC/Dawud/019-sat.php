        <p> Ghalib quoted a man who stated on the authority of his father that his grandfather reported: They lived at one of the springs. When Islam reached them, the master of the spring offered his people one hundred camels if they embraced Islam. So they embraced Islam, and he distributed the camels among them. But it occurred to him that he should take the camels back from them. </p>
        <p> He sent his son to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said to him: Go to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and tell him: My father extends his greetings to you. He asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam, and they embraced Islam. He divided the camels among them. But it occurred to him then that he should withdraw his camels from them. Is he more entitled to them or we? If he says: Yes or no, then tell him: My father is an old man, and he is the chief of the people living at the water. He has requested you to make me chief after him. </p>
        <p> He came to him and said: My father has extended his greetings to you.  He replied: On you and you father be peace.  He said: My father asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam. So they embraced Islam, and their belief in Islam is good. Then it occurred to him that he should take his camels back from them. Is he more entitled to them or are they? </p>
        <p> He said: If he likes to give them the camels, he may give them; and if he likes to take them back, he is more entitled to them than his people. If they embraced Islam, then for them is their Islam. If they do not embrace Islam, they will be fought against in the cause of Islam. </p>
        <p> He said: My father is an old man; he is the chief of the people living at the spring. He has asked you to appoint me chief after him. </p>
        <p> He replied: The office of a chief is necessary, for people must have chiefs, but the chiefs will go to Hell. </p>

He asked: For whom do you think?  Ibn Abbas replied: For the relatives of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) divided it among them. Umar presented it to us but we found it less than our right. We, therefore returned it to him and refused to accept it. </p>

He said: He did that. He said: I divided it during the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). AbuBakr then assigned it to me. During the last days of the caliphate of Umar a good deal of property came to him and took out our portion. I said to him: We are well to do this year; but the Muslims are needy, so return it to them. He, therefore, returned it to them. No one called me after Umar. I met al-Abbas when I came out from Umar. He said: Ali, today you have deprived us of a thing that will never be returned to us. He was indeed a man of wisdom. </p>

        <p> AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith said that his father, Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith, and Abbas ibn al-Muttalib said to AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah and al-Fadl ibn Abbas: Go to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and tell him: Apostle of Allah, we are now of age as you see, and we wish to marry. Apostle of Allah, you are the kindest of the people and the most skilled in matchmaking. Our fathers have nothing with which to pay our dower. So appoint us collector of sadaqah (zakat), Apostle of Allah, and we shall give you what the other collectors give you, and we shall have the benefit accruing from it. Ali came to us while we were in this condition. </p>
        <p> He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: No, I swear by Allah, he will not appoint any of you collector of sadaqah (zakat). </p>
        <p> Rabi'ah said to him: This is your condition; you have gained your relationship with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) by marriage, but we did not grudge you that. Ali then put his cloak on the earth and lay on it. </p>
        <p> He then said: I am the father of Hasan, the chief. I swear by Allah, I shall not leave this place until your sons come with a reply (to the question) for which you have sent them to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). </p>
        <p> AbdulMuttalib said: So I and al-Fadl went towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). We found that the noon prayer in congregation had already started. So we prayed along with the people. I and al-Fadl then hastened towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). He was (staying) with Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, that day. We stood until the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came. He caught my ear and the ear of al-Fadl. </p>
        <p> He then said: Reveal what you conceal in your hearts. He then entered  and permitted me and al-Fadl (to enter). So we entered and for a little while we asked each other to talk. I then talked to him, or al-Fadl talked to him (the narrator, Abdullah was not sure). </p>
        <p> He said: He spoke to him concerning the matter about which our fathers ordered us to ask him. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) remained silent for a moment and raised his eyes towards the ceiling of the room. He took so long that we thought he would not give any reply to us. Meanwhile we saw that Zaynab was signalling to us with her hand from behind the veil, asking us not to be in a hurry, and that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was (thinking) about our matter. </p>
        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then lowered his head and said to us: This sadaqah (zakat) is a dirt of the people. It is legal neither for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad. Call Nawfal ibn al-Harith to me. So Nawfal ibn al-Harith was called to him. </p>
        <p> He said: Nawfal, marry AbdulMuttalib (to your daughter). So Nawfal married me (to his daughter). </p>
        <p> The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) then said: Call Mahmiyyah ibn Jaz'i to me. He was a man of Banu Zubayd, whom the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had appointed collector of the fifths. </p>
        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to Mahmiyyah: Marry al-Fadl (to your daughter). So he married him to her. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Stand up and pay the dower from the fifth so-and-so on their behalf. Abdullah ibn al-Harith did not name it (i.e. the amount of the dower). </p>

        <p> Narrated A man from the companions of the Prophet: </p>
        <p> AbdurRahman ibn Ka'b ibn Malik reported on the authority of a man from among the companions of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him): The infidels of the Quraysh wrote (a letter) to Ibn Ubayy and to those who worshipped idols from al-Aws and al-Khazraj, while the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was at that time at Medina before the battle of Badr. </p>
        <p> (They wrote): You gave protection to our companion. We swear by Allah, you should fight him or expel him, or we shall come to you in full force, until we kill your fighters and appropriate your women. </p>
        <p> When this (news) reached Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with him they gathered together to fight the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). </p>
        <p> When this news reached the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh. </p>
        <p> The infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty. </p>
        <p> They sent a message to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story. </p>
        <p> When the next day came, the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them. </p>
        <p> He told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore fought them the same day. </p>
        <p> Next he attacked Banu Quraysh with an army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to sign a treaty and they signed it. </p>
        <p> He turned away from them and attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until they agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their property, the doors of their houses, and their wood. Palm-trees were exclusively reserved for the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). Allah bestowed them upon him and gave them him as a special portion. </p>
        <p> He (Allah), the Exalted, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them, for this ye made no expedition with either camel corps or cavalry." He said: "Without fighting." So the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) gave most of it to the emigrants and divided it among them; and he divided some of it between two men from the helpers, who were needy, and he did not divide it among any of the helpers except those two. The rest of it survived as the sadaqah of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) which is in the hands of the descendants of Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her). </p>

        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) concluded peace with the people of Najran on condition that they would pay to Muslims two thousand suits of garments, half of Safar, and the rest in Rajab, and they would lend (Muslims) thirty coats of mail, thirty horses, thirty camels, and thirty weapons of each type used in battle. Muslims will stand surely for them until they return them in case there is any plot or treachery in the Yemen. No church of theirs will be demolished and no clergyman of theirs will be turned out. There will be no interruption in their religion until they bring something new or take usury. Isma'il said: They took usury. </p>

        <p> Narrated Abdullah al-Hawzani: </p>
        <p> I met Bilal, the Mu'adhdhin of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) at Aleppo, and said: Bilal, tell me, what was the financial position of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)? </p>
        <p> He said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him. </p>
        <p> A man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants. </p>
        <p> When he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian.  I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me.  He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month?  I replied: The time is near.  He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission. </p>
        <p> I said: Apostle of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (peace_be_upon_him) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way. </p>
        <p> All of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission. </p>
        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground? </p>
        <p> I replied: Yes.  He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so. </p>
        <p> He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was sitting there. I greeted him. </p>
        <p> He asked: What benefit did you have from your property?  I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). Nothing remains now. </p>
        <p> He asked: Did anything remain (from that property)?  I said: Yes.  He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)? </p>
        <p> I said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) passed the night in the mosque. </p>
        <p> He then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)? </p>
        <p> I replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Apostle of Allah.  He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you asked me. </p>

        <p> The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If anyone takes land by (paying) its jizyah, he renounces his immigration; and if anyone takes off the disgrace of an unbeliever from his neck he turns away his back from Islam. He (the narrator) said: Thereafter Khalid ibn Ma'dan heard this tradition from me, and he said: Has Shubayb narrated it to you? I said: Yes. He said! When you come to him, ask him to write this tradition to me. He said: He then wrote it for him. When I came, Khalid ibn Ma'dan asked me for the paper and I gave it to him. When he read (the paper), he abandoned the lands he had in his possession the moment he heard this. </p>

        <p> Al-Miqdad went to Baqi' al-Khabkhabah for a certain need. He found a mouse taking out a dinar from a hole. It then continued to take out dinars one by one until it took out seventeen dinars. It then took out a red purse containing a dinar. There were thus eighteen dinars. He took them to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), informed him and said to him: Take its sadaqah. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) asked him: Did you extend your hand toward the hole? He replied: No. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then said: May Allah bless you in it. </p>

        <p> When we went out along with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) to at-Ta'if we passed a grave. I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: This is the grave of AbuRighal. He was in this sacred mosque (sanctuary) protecting himself (from punishment). When he came out, he suffered the same punishment which his people suffered at this place, and he was buried in it. The sign of it is that a golden bough was buried with him. If you dig it out, you will find it with him. The people hastened to it and took out the bough. </p>
