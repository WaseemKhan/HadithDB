        <p> Thereupon, Imran got angry and said to the man: Do you find in the Qur'an that one dirham is due on forty dirhams (as Zakat), and one goat is due on such-and-such number of goats, and one camel will be due on such-and-such number of camels? </p>
        <p> He replied: No. </p>
        <p> He said: From whom did you take it? You took it from us, from the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar: </p>
        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wrote a letter about sadaqah (zakat) but he died before he could send it to his governors. He had kept it  with his sword. So AbuBakr acted upon it till he died, and then Umar acted upon it till he died. </p>
        <p> It contained: "For five camels one goat is to be given; for ten camels two goats are to be given; for fifteen camels three goats are to be given; for twenty camels four goats are to be given; for twenty-five to thirty-five camels a she-camel in her second year is to be given. If the number exceeds by one up to seventy camels, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to seventy-five camels, a she-camel in her fifth year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to ninety camels, two she-camels in their third year are to be given; if they exceed by one up to one hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year are to be given. If the camels are more than this, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given for every fifty camels, and a she-camel in her third year is to be given for every forty camels. </p>
        <p> For forty to one hundred and twenty goats one goat is to be given; if they exceed by one up to two hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed by one up to three hundred, three goats are to be given; if the goats are more than this, one goat for every hundred goats is to be given. Nothing is payable until they reach one hundred. Those which are in one flock are not to be separated, and those which are in separate flocks are not be brought together from fear of sadaqah (zakat). Regarding that which belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from each other with equity. An old goat and a defective one are not to be accepted as sadaqah (zakat)." </p>
        <p> Az-Zuhri said: When the collector comes, the goats will be apportioned into three flocks: one containing bad, the second good, and the third moderate. The collector will take zakat from the moderate. Az-Zuhri did not mention the cows (to be apportioned in three flocks). </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p> Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib: </p>
        <p> Al-Harith al-A'war reported from Ali. Zuhayr said: I think, the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: "Pay a fortieth. A dirham is payable on every forty, but you are not liable for payment until you have accumulated two hundred dirhams. When you have two hundred dirhams, five dirhams are payable, and that proportion is applicable to larger amounts. </p>
        <p> "Regarding sheep, for every forty sheep up to one hundred and twenty, one sheep is due. But if you possess only thirty-nine, nothing is payable on them." He further narrated the tradition about the sadaqah (zakat) on sheep like that of az-Zuhri. </p>
        <p> "Regarding cattle, a yearling bull calf is payable for every thirty, and a cow in her third year for forty, and nothing is payable on working animals. </p>
        <p> Regarding (the zakat on) camels, he mentioned the rates that az-Zuhri mentioned in his tradition. He said: "For twenty-five camels, five sheep are to be paid. If they exceed by one, a she-camel in her second year is to be given. If there is no she-camel in her second year, a male camel in its third year is to be given, up to thirty-five. If they exceed by one a she-camel in her third year is to be given, up to forty-five. If they exceed by one, a she-camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a bull-camel is to be given." He then transmitted the rest of the tradition like that of az-Zuhri. </p>
        <p> He continued: If they exceed by one, i.e. they are ninety-one to hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year, which are ready to be covered by a bull-camel, are to be given. If there are more camels than that, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given for every fifty. Those which are in one flock are not to be separated, and those which are separate are not to be brought together. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a billy goat is not to be accepted as a sadaqah unless the collector is willing. </p>
        <p> As regards agricultural produce, a tenth is payable on that which is watered by rivers or rain, and a twentieth on that which is watered by draught camels." </p>
        <p> The version of Asim and al-Harith says: "Sadaqah (zakat) is payable every year." Zuhayr said: I think he said "Once a year". </p>
        <p> The version of Asim has the words: "If a she-camel in her second year is not available among the camels, nor is there a bull-camel in its third year, ten dirhams or two goats are to be given." </p>

Nothing is incumbent on you, that is, on gold, till it reaches twenty dinars. When you possess twenty dinars and one year passes on them, half a dinar is payable. Whatever exceeds, that will be reckoned properly." </p>

        <p> The collector used to visit the water-hole when the sheep went there and say: Pay the sadaqah (zakat) on your property.  The narrator said: A man wanted to give him his high-humped camel (kawma').  The narrator (Hilal) asked: What is kawma', AbuSalih?  He said: A camel a high hump. </p>
        <p> The narrator continued: He (the collector) refused to accept it. He said: I wish you could take the best of my camels. He refused to accept it. He then brought another camel lower in quality than the previous one. He refused to accept it too. He then brought another camel lower in quality than the previous one. He accepted it, saying: I shall take it, but I am afraid the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) might be angry with me, saying to me: You have purposely taken from a man a camel of your choice. </p>

        <p> I said: My father has sent me to you to collect zakat from you.  He asked: What kind of animals will you take, my nephew?  I replied: We shall select the sheep and examine their udders.

Two people riding a camel came to me. </p>

        <p> Narrated Ubayy ibn Ka'b: </p>
        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) commissioned me as a collector of zakat. I visited a man. When he had collected his property of camels, I found that a she-camel in her second year was due from him. </p>
        <p> I said to him: Pay a she-camel in her second year, for she is to be paid as sadaqah (zakat) by you. </p>
        <p> He said: That one is not worthy of milking and riding. Here is another she-camel which is young, grand and fat. So take it. </p>
        <p> I said to him: I shall not take an animal for which I have not been commanded. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) is here near to you. If you like, go to him, and present to him what you presented to me. Do that; if he accepts it from you, I shall accept it; if he rejects it, I shall reject it. </p>
        <p> He said: I shall do it. He accompanied me and took with him the she-camel which he had presented to me. We came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). He said to him: Prophet of Allah, your messenger came to me to collect zakat on my property. By Allah, neither the Apostle of Allah nor his messenger has ever seen my property before. I gathered my property (camels), and he estimated that a she-camel in her second year would be payable by me. But that has neither milk nor is it worth riding. So I presented to him a grand young she-camel for acceptance as  zakat. But he has refused to take her. Look, she is here; I have brought her to you, Apostle of Allah. Take her. </p>
        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: That is what is due from you. If you give voluntarily a better (animal) Allah will give a reward to you for it. We accept her from you. </p>
        <p> She is here, Apostle of Allah; I have brought her to you. So take her. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then ordered me to take possession of it, and he prayed for a blessing on his property. </p>

He then said to him: Let me inform you about the best a man hoards; it is a virtuous woman who pleases him when he looks at her, obeys him when he gives her a command, and guards his interests when he is away from her. </p>
