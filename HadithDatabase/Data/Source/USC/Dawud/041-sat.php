        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to sit with us in meetings and talk to us. When he stood up we also used to stand up and see him entering the house of one of his wives. One day he talked to us and we stood up as he stood up and we saw that an Arabi (a nomadic Arab) caught hold of him and gave his cloak a violent tug making his neck red. </p>
        <p> AbuHurayrah said: The cloak was coarse. He turned to him and the Arabi said to him: Load these two camels of mine, for you do not give me anything from your property or from your father's property. </p>
        <p> The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said to him: No, I ask Allah's forgiveness; no, I ask Allah's forgiveness; no, I ask Allah's forgiveness. I shall not give you the camel-load until you make amends for the way in which you tugged at me. </p>
        <p> Each time the Arabi said to him: I swear by Allah, I shall not do so. </p>
        <p> He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. He (the Prophet), then called a man and said to him: Load these two camels of his: one camel with barley and the other with dates. He then turned to us and said: Go on your way with the blessing of Allah. </p>

He did not mention the words "Allah will call him". This version further adds: He who gives up wearing beautiful garments when he is able to do so (out of humility, as Bishr's version has) will be clothed by Allah with the robe of honour, and he who marries for Allah's sake will be crowned by Allah with the crown of Kingdom. </p>

        <p> Two men reviled each other in the presence of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and one of them became excessively angry so much so that I thought that his nose will break up on account of excess of anger. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: I know a phrase which, if he repeated, he could get rid of this angry feeling. They asked: What is it, Apostle of Allah? He replied: He should say: I seek refuge in Thee from the accursed devil. Mu'adh then began to ask him to do so, but he refused and persisted in quarrelling, and began to enhance his anger. </p>

So he stood and performed ablution; he then returned and performed ablution, and said: My father told me on the authority of my grandfather Atiyyah who reported the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) as saying: Anger comes from the devil, the devil was created of fire, and fire is extinguished only with water; so when one of you becomes angry, he should perform ablution. </p>

        <p> While the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was sitting with some of his companions, a man reviled AbuBakr and insulted him. But AbuBakr remained silent. He insulted him twice, but AbuBakr controlled himself. He insulted him thrice and AbuBakr took revenge on him. Then the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) got up when AbuBakr took revenge. </p>
        <p> AbuBakr said: Were you angry with me, Apostle of Allah? </p>
        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) replied: An angel came down from Heaven and he was rejecting what he had said to you. When you took revenge, a devil came down. I was not going to sit when the devil came down. </p>

Then Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an told me on the authority of Umm Muhammad, the wife of his father. </p>
        <p> Ibn Awn said: It was believed that she used to go to the Mother of the Faithful (i.e. Aisha).  She said: The Mother of the Faithful said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came upon me while Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, was with us. He began to do something with his hand. I signalled to him until I made him understand about her. So he stopped. Zaynab came on and began to abuse Aisha. She tried to prevent her but she did not stop. </p>
        <p> So he (the Prophet) said to Aisha: Abuse her. </p>
        <p> So she abused her and dominated her.  Zaynab then went to Ali and said: Aisha abused you and did (such and such).  Then Fatimah came (to the Prophet) and he said to her: She is the favourite of your father, by the Lord of the Ka'bah! </p>
        <p> She then returned and said to them: I said to him such and such, and he said to me such and such. Then Ali came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and spoke to him about that. </p>

One of them would commit sin and the other would strive to do his best in the world. The man who exerted himself in worship continued to see the other in sin. </p>
        <p> He would say: Refrain from it. One day he found him in sin and said to him: Refrain from it. </p>

        <p> When he gave a greeting, my father said: May Allah have mercy on you! Tell me about this prayer: Is it obligatory or supererogatory? </p>

        <p> He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to say: Do not impose austerities on yourselves so that austerities will be imposed on you, for people have imposed austerities on themselves and Allah imposed austerities on them. Their survivors are to be found in cells and monasteries. (Then he quoted:) "Monasticism, they invented it; we did not prescribe it for them." </p>
        <p> Next day he went out in the morning and said: will you not go out for a ride, so that you may see something and take a lesson from it? </p>

        <p> He asked: Do you know this land?  I said: Who acquainted me with it and its inhabitants?  (Anas said:) This is the land of the people whom oppression and envy destroyed. Envy extinguishes the light of good deeds, and oppression confirms or falsifies it.

        <p> This verse was revealed  about us, the Banu Salimah: "Nor call each other by (offensive) nicknames: ill-seeming is a name connoting wickedness (to be used of one) after he has believed." He said: When the apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came to us, every one of us had two or three names. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) began to say: O so and so! But they would say: Keep silence, Apostle of Allah! He becomes angry by this name. So this verse was revealed: "Nor call each other by (offensive nicknames." </p>

The word of Allah, Most High, reads: "O ye who believe! Let those whom your right hands possess, and the (children) among you, who have not come of age, ask your permission (before) they enter your presence on three occasions: before morning prayer, while you are undressing for the noonday heat, and after late-night prayer. These are your three times of undress; outside those times it is not wrong for you or for them to move about." </p>
        <p> Al-Qa'nabi recited the verse up to "full of knowledge and wisdom". </p>
        <p> Ibn Abbas said: Allah is Most Clement and Most Merciful to the believers. He loves concealment. The people had neither curtains nor curtained canopies in their houses. Sometimes a servant, a child or a female orphan of a man entered while the man was having sexual intercourse with his wife. So Allah commanded them to ask permission in those times of undress. Then Allah brought them curtains and all good things. But I did not see anyone following it after that. </p>

        <p> Narrated Anas ibn Malik: </p>
        <p> The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came out, and on seeing a high-domed building, he said: What is it? </p>
        <p> His companions replied to him: It belongs to so and so, one of the Ansar. </p>
        <p> He said: he said nothing but kept the matter in mind. When its owner came and gave him a greeting among the people, he turned away from him. When he had done this several times, the man realised that he was the cause of the anger and the rebuff. </p>
        <p> So he complained about it to his companions, saying: I swear by Allah that I cannot understand the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). </p>
        <p> They said: He went out and saw your domed building. So the man returned to it and demolished it, levelling it to the ground. One day the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came out and did not see it. </p>
        <p> He asked: What has happened to the domed building? </p>
        <p> They replied: Its owner complained to us about your rebuff, and when we informed him about it, he demolished it. </p>
        <p> He said: Every building is a misfortune for its owner, except what cannot, except what cannot, meaning except that which is essential. </p>
