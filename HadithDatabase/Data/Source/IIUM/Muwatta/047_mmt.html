Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not have to choose between two matters, but that he chose the easier of them as long as it was not a wrong action. If it was a wrong action, he was the furthest of people from it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not take revenge for himself unless the limits of Allah were violated. Then he took revenge for it for Allah."

Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A man asked permission to come in to see the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave him permission."
</p>
<p>
A'isha continued, "It was not long before I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, laughing with him. When the man left, I said, 'Messenger of Allah, you said what you said about him, and then before long you were laughing with him.' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, replied, 'Among the most evil of people is the one whom people are cautious with because of his evil.' "
