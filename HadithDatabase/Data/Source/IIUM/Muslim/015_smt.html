Abu Musa reported: My friends sent me to Allah's Messenger (may peace

in jaish al-'Usrah (the army of destitutes or of meagre means or army setting out
during the hard times and that is the occasion of the expedition of Tabuk) I said:
Apostle of Allah, my friends have sent me to you so that you may provide them with
mounts.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with anything to
ride.  And it so happened that he was at that time much perturbed.  I little knew of it, so
I came back with a heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him), and the fear that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
might have some feelings against me.  I returned to my friends and informed them
about what Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said.  I had hardly stayed
for a little that I heard Bilal calling: 'Abdullah b. Qais.  I responded to his call.  He
said: Hasten to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), he is calling you, When
I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) he said: Take this pair,this pair,
and this pair (i.e. six camels which he had bought from Sa'd), and take them to y,our
friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: Verily Allah's Messenger (may peace be
upon him) has provided you with these animals.  So ride upon them.  Abu Musa said:
I went along with them to my friends and said: Verily Allah's messenger (may peace
be upon him) has provided you with these animals for riding; but by Allah, I shall not
leave you until some of you go along with me to him who had heard the talk of
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) then I asked him for you, and his refusal
for the first time, and then his granting them to me subsequently; so you should not
think that I narrated to you something which he did not say.  They said to me: By
Allah, in our opinion you are certainly truthful, and we would do as you like.  So Abu
Musa went along withsome of the menfrom them until they came to those who had heard
the words of Allah's Messenger (may, peace be upon him) and his refusal to (provide)
them with (animals) ; and subsequently his granting (the animals) to them; and they
narrated to them exactly as Abu Masa had narrated to them.

Ayyub said: We were sitting in the company of Abu Musa that he called
for food and it consisted of flesh of fowl.  It was then that a person from Banu Tamim
visited him.  His complexion was red having the resemblance of a slave.  He said to
him: Come and (join me in food).  He showed reluctance.  He (Abu Masa) said: Come
on, for I saw Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) eating it (fowl's meat),
whereupon that person said: I saw it eating something (of filth and rubbish) and I
found it repugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that.  He (Abu Muds)
said: Come, so that I would narrate to you about that (the incident pertaining to
vow). (And he narrated thus) : I came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
along with a group of people belonging to the tribe of Ash'ari, asking him to provide
us with riding camels.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with
riding animals.  And there is nothing with me with which I can provide you a mount.
We stayed (for some time) there as Allah willed, and there was brought to Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) booty of camels.  He called us and commanded
that we should be given five white humped camels.  As we were about to go back,
some of us said to the other: As we made Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift).  We went back to him and
said: Allah's Messenger, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you
took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided
us with the riding beasts Allali's Messenger, have you forgotten ? Thereupon he said: I
swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider
something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing
the thing that is better.  So you go; Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has given you
riding animals.
