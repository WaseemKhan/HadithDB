<p> 
'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited
(these verses of the Qur'an) : "He it is Who revealed to thee (Muhammad) the Book (the
Qur'an) wherein there are clear revelations-these are the substance of the Book and
others are allegorical (verses). And as for those who have a yearning for error they
go after the allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain them.
And none knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge
say: We affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord.  It is only the persons
of understanding who really heed" (iii. 6).  'A'isha (further) reported that Allah's 
Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (in connection with these verses) : When you see
such verses, avoid them, for it is they whom Allah has pointed out (in the
mentioned verses).

me that 'Abdullah b. 'Amr al-'As would pass by us during the Hajj season, so you 
meet him and ask him (about religious matters) as he has acquired great knowledge
from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I thus met him and asked him
about things which he narrated from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him).  And
amongst these the one he mentioned was that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him)
said: Verily, Allah does not take away knowledge from people directly but he takes
away the scholars and consequently takes away (knowledge) along with them and leaves
amongst persons the ignorant as their leaders who deliver religious verdicts without
(adequate) knowledge and themselves go astray and lead others astray.  'Urwa said:
When I narrated this to 'A'isha, she deemed it too much (to believe) and thus showed
reluctance to accept that (as perfectly true) and said to 'Urwa: Did he ('Abdullah b.
'Amr) say to you that he had heard Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying:
('Urwa had forgotten to ask this from 'Abdullah b. 'Amr).  So when it was the next
year, she ('A'isha) said to him ('Urwa): Ibn Amr has come (for Hajj), so meet him.
talk to him and ask him about this hadith that he narrated to You (last year on the
occasion of the Hajj) pertaining to knowledge.  He ('Urwa), said: So I met him, and asked
about it and he  narrated to me exactly like one that he had narrated (to me) for the
first time.  So when I informed her ('A'isha) about that, she said: I do not think but
this that he has certainly told the truth and I find that he has neither made any
addition to it, nor missed anything from it.
