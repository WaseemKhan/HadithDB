INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
The Arabic word for divorce is talaq which means "freeing or undoing the knot"
(Imam Raghib).In the terminology of the jurists. Talaq signifies the dissolution of
marriage, or the annulment of its legality by the pronouncement of certain words.</p>
<p>
 Divorce is of three kinds: the<i> Ahsan,</i> or most laudable, the<i> Hasan,</i> or laudable,
and the <i>Bid'a</i> or irregular.</p>
<p>
 Talaq Ahsan or the most laudable divorce is where the husband repudiates his
wife by making one pronouncement within the term of Tahr (purity. when the woman
is not passing through the period of menses) during which he has not had sexual intercourse 
with her, and she is left to observe her 'Idda.</p>
<p>
 Talaq Hasan or laudable divorce is where a husband repudiates an enjoyed wife by
three sentences of divorce, in three Tuhrs</p>
<p>
 Talaq Bid'a or irregular divorce is where a husband repudiates his wife by three
divorces at once. According to the majority of the jurists, the Talaq holds good, but
it is against the spirit of the Shari'ah, and, therefore, the man who follows this course
in divorce is an offender in the eye of Islamic Law.</p>
<p>
 The right of woman in demanding the dissolution of marriage is known as Khula'
(meaning, literally,the putting off or taking off a thing).It is a kind of facility
provided to the wife in securing Talaq from her husband by returning a part or full
amount of the bridal gift. </p>
<p>
 We have described before that, according to Islam, marriage is a civil contract;
yet the rights and responsibilities consequent upon it are of such importance to the
welfare of humanity that a high degree of sanctity is attached to it.But, in spite of
the sacredness of the character of the marriage tie,Islam recognises the eternity of
divorce in cases when marital relations are poisoned to a degree which makes a peaceful
home life impossible.But Islam does not believe in unlimited opportunities for divorce
on frivolous and flimsy grounds, because any undue increase in tht facilities for
divorce would destroy the stability of family life.Therefore, while allowing divorce
even on genuine grounds, Islam has taken great care to introduce checks designed to
limit the use of available facilities. The French legists Planiol and Ripert have
explicitly emphasised Islam's point of view in regard to divorce in these words:
"Divorce is a mischief.However, it is a measure that cannot be avoided for the
welfare of the community, because it is the only remedy for another harm which may
be wore dangerous The prohibition of divorce, whatever harm it may imply, is like
the prohibition of surgery, because the surgeon is compelled to amputate some of the
limbs of the patient's body.However, there is no danger whatsoever, in legislating
for divorce (in accordance with the practice established by Islam) since it is not divorce
that spoils married life and dissolves its sacred tie, but the misunderstanding that arises
between the married couple and hinders the strengthening of this (union by marriage) and
demolished it.Divorce alone puts an end to the hatred that may occur between the
husband and his wife before it is aggravated and becomes an intolerable mischief to
society" (quoted by Hasan Ibrihim Hasan, Islam, Religious, Political.Social and
Economic Study, p. 274).

Ibn 'Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife
while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (may peace be
upon him).'Umar b. Khattib (Allah be pleased with him) asked Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) about it, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) said: Command him ('Abdullah b. 'Umar) to take her back (and keep her) and
pronounce divorce when she is purified and she again enters the period of menstruation
and she is again purified (after passing the period of menses), and then if he so desires
he may keep her and if he desires divorce her (finally) before touching her (without
having an intercourse with her), for that is the period of waiting ('ldda) which God,
the Exalted and Glorious, has commanded for the divorce of women.

<p>
Abdullah (b.'Umar) reported that he divorced a wife of his with the
pronouncement of one divorce during the period of menstruation.Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) commanded him to take her back and keep her until she was
purified, and then she entered the period of menses in his (house) for the second time.
And he should wait until she was purified of her menses.And then if he would decide
to divorce her, he should do so when she was purified before having a sexual 
intercourse with her; for that was the 'Idda which Allah had commanded for the divorce
of women.Ibn Rumh in his narration made this addition: When 'Abdullah was asked
about it, he said to one of them: If you have divorced your wife with one pronouncement 
or two (then you can take her back), for Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) commanded me to do it; but if you have divorced her with three pronouncements,
then she is forbidden for you until she married another husband, and you disobeyed
Allah in regard to the divorce of your wife what He had commanded you. (Muslim
said: The word "one divorce" used by Laith is good.)

then allow her respite until she is purified, then divorce her (finally) before touching
her (having a sexual intercourse with her), for that is the prescribed period which
Allah commanded (to be kept in view) for divorcing the women.When Ibn 'Umar

 Jabir b. 'Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: Abu Bakr (Allah
 be pleased with him) came and sought permission to see Allah's Messenger (may peace
 be upon him).He found people sitting at his door and none amongst them had been
 granted permission, but it was granted to Abu Bakr and he went in.Then came 'Umar
 and he sought permission and it was granted to him, and he found Allah's Apostle
(may peace be upon him) sitting sad and silent with his wives around him.He (Hadrat
'Umar) said: I would say something which would make the Holy Prophet (may peace
be upon him) laugh, so he said: Messenger of Allah, I wish you had seen (the treatment
meted out to) the daughter ofKhadija when you asked me some money, and I got up and
slapped her on her neck.Allah's Messenger (mav peace be upon him) laughed and said:
They are around me as you see, asking for extra money.Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with
him) then got up went to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and slapped her on the
neck, and 'Umar stood up before Hafsa and slapped her saying: You ask Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) which he does not possess.They said: By Allah, we do not ask
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) for anything he does not possess.Then he
withdrew from them for a month or for twenty-nine days.Then this verse was revealed 
to him: "Prophet: Say to thy wives . . . for a mighty reward" (xxxiii. 28).He then
went first to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and said: I want to propound something 
to you, 'A'isha, but wish no hasty reply before you consult your parents.She said:
Messenger of Allah, what is that?He (the Holy Prophet) recited to her the verse,
whereupon she said: Is it about you that I should consult my parents, Messenger of
Allah?Nay, I choose Allah, His Messenger, and the Last Abode; but I ask you not to
tell any of your wives what I have said He replied: Not one of them will ask me
without my informing her.God did not send me to be harsh, or cause harm, but He
has sent me to teach and make things easy.

'Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Allah's
Apostle (may peace be upon him) kept himself away from his wives, I entered the
mosque, and found people striking the ground with pebblesand saying: Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) has divorced his wives, and that was before they
were commanded to observe seclusion 'Umar said to himself: I must find this (actual
position) today.So I went to 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) and said (to her):
Daughter of Abu Bakr, have you gone to the extent of giving trouble to Allah's Messenger 
(may peace be upon him)?Thereupon she said: Son of Khattab, you have
nothing to do with me, and I have nothing to do with you.You should look to your
own receptacle. He ('Umar) said: I visited Hafsa daughter of 'Umar, and said to
her: Hafsa, the (news) has reached me that you cause Allah's Messenger (may peace be
upon him) trouble.You know that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) does not
love you, and had I not been (your father) he would have divorced you. (On hearing
this) she wept bitterly.I said to her: Where is Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him)?Shesaid: He is in the attic room.I went in and found Rabah, the servant of Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him),sitting on the thresholds of the window dangling
his feet on the hollow wood of the date-palm with the help of which Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) climbed (to the apartment) and came down.I cried: 0 Rabah,
seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him). Rabah cast a
glance at the apartment and then looked toward me but said nothing. I again said:
Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him).Rabah
looked towards the apartment and then cast a glance at me, but said nothig. I then
raised my voice and said: 0 Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him). I think that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) is
under the impression that I have come for the sake of Hafsa.By Allah, if Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) would command me to strike her neck, I would
certainly strike her neck. I raised my voice and he pointed me to climb up (and get
into his apartment). I visited Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and
he was lying on a mat.I sat down and he drew up his lower garment over him and he
had nothing (else) over him, and that the mat had left its marks on his sides. I looked
with my eyes in the store room of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I found
only a handful of barley equal to one sa' and an equal quantity of the leaves of Mimosa
Flava placed in th(t nook of the cell, and a semi-tanned leather bag hanging (in one
side), and I was moved to tears (on seeing this extremely austere living of the Holy
Piophet), and he said: Ibn Khattab, what wakes you weep? I said: Apostle of Allah,
why should I not shed tears?This mat has left its marks on your sides and I do not
see in your store room (except these few things) that I have seen ; Ceasar and Closroes
are leading their lives in plenty whereas you are Allah's Messenger.His chosen one,
and that is your store ! He said: Ibn Khattab, aren't you satisfied that for us (there
should be the prosperity) of the Hereafter, and for them (there should be the prosperity 
of) this world?I said: Yes.And as I had entered I had seen the signs of anger on
his face, and I therefore, said: Messenger of Allah, what trouble do you feel from your
wives, and if youhave divorced them, verily Allah is with you, His angels, Gabriel,
Mika'il, I and Abu Bakr and the believers are with you.And seldom I talked and
(which I uttered on that day) I hoped that Allah would testify to my words that I uttered.
And so the verse of option (Ayat al-Takhyir) was revealed.Maybe his Lord, if he
divorce you, will give him in your place wives better than you . . ." (Ixv. 5).And if
you back up one another against him, then surely Allah is his Patron, and Gabriel and
the righteous believers, and the angels after that are the aidera (lvi. 4).And it was
'A'isha,daughter of Abu Bakr, and Hafsa who had prevailed upon all the wives of
Allah's Prophet (way peace be upon him) for (pressing them for mote money).I said:
Messenger of Allah, have you divorced them?He said: No. I said: Messenger of Allah,
I entered the mosque and found the Muslims playing with pebbles (absorbed in
thought) and saying: Allah's Messenger has divorced his wives.Should I get down
and inform there that you have not divorced them?He said: Yes, if you so like.
And I went on talking to him until I (found) the signs of anger disappeared on
his face and (his seriousness was changed to a happy mood and as a result thereof)
his face had the natural tranquillity upon it and he laughed and his teeth were the
most charming (among the teeth) of all people.Then Allah's Apostle (may peace be
upon him) climbed down and I also climbed down and catching hold of the wood of the
palm-tree and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came down (with such ease)
as if he was walking on the ground, not touching anything with his hand (to get
support). I said: Messenger of Allah, you remained in your apartment for twenty-nine
days.He said: (At times) the month consists of twenty-nine days.I stood at the door
of the mosque and I called out at the top of my voice: The Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him) has not divorced his wives (and it was on this occasion that this)
verse was revealed: "And if any matter pertaining to peace or alarm comes within
their ken, they broadcast it; whereas, if they would refer it to the Apostle and those
who have been entrusted with authority amongst them, those of them who are engaged
in obtaining intelligence would indeed know (what to do with) it" (iv 83).
And it was I who understood this matter, and Allah revealed the verse pertaining
to option (given to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him in regard to the
retaining or divorcing of his wives).

Abdullah b. Abbas (Allah be pleased with tlicm) reported: I intended to
ask 'Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) about a verse, but I waited for
one year to ask him out of his fear, until he went out for Pilgrimage and I also
accompanied him.As he came back and we were on the way he stepped aside towards
an Arak tree to ease himself.I waited for him until he was free. I then walked
along with him and said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two among the
wives of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) who backed up one another (in
their demand for extra money)?He said: They were Hafsa and 'A'isha (Allah be
pleased with them).I said to him: It is for one year that I intended to ask you about
this matter but I could not date so on account of the awe for you.He said: Don't do
that.If you think that I have any knowledge, do ask me about that.And if I were to
know that, I would inform you. He (the narrator) stated that 'Umar had said: By
Allah, during the days of ignorance we had no regard for women until Allah the Exalt-
ed revealed about them what He has revealed, and appointed (turn) for them what he
appointed.He said: It so happened that I was thinking about some matter that my wife
said: I wish you had done that and that.I said to her: It does not concern you and
you should not feel disturbed in a matter which I intend to do.She said to me: How
strange is it that you, O son of Khattab, do not like anyone to retort upon you,
whereas your daughter retorts upon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upou him) until he
spends the day in vexation.'Umar said: I took hold of my cloak, then came out of
my house until I visited Hafsa and said to her: O daughter, (I heard) that you retort
upon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) until he spends the day in vexation,
whereupon Hafsa said: By Allah, we do retort upon him.I said: You should bear in
mind, my daughter, that I warn you against the punishment of Allah and the wrath
of His Messenger (may peace be upon him).You may not be misled by one whose
beauty has fascinated her, and the love of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
for her.I ('Umar) then visited Umm Salama because of my relationship with her
and I talked to her.Umm Salama said to me: Umar b. al-Khattab, how strange is it
that you meddle with every matter so much so that you are anxious to interfere
between Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his wives, and this perturbed
me so much that I refrained from saying what I had to say, so I came out of her
apartment, and I had a friend from the Anar.When I had been absent (from the
company of the Holy Prophet) he used to bring me the news and when he had been
absent I used to bring him the news, and at that time we dreaded a king of Ghassan.
It was mentioned to us that he intended to attack us, and our minds were haunted
by him. My friend, the Ansari, came to me, and he knocked at the door and said: Open
it, open it. I said: Has the Ghassani come?He said: (The matter is) more serious
than that.The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has separated himself from
his wives.I said: Let the nose of Hafsa and 'A'isha be besmeared with dust.I then
took hold of my cloth and went out until I came and found Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him) in his attic to which he climbed by means of a ladder made of
date-palm, and the servant of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) who
was black had been sitting at the end of the ladder.I said: This is Umar.
So permission was granted to me.I narrated this news to Allah's Messenger (may peace
be upon him) and as I narrated the news concerning Umm Salama, Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) smiled.He was lying on the mat and there was nothing
between him and that (mat), and under his head there was a pillow made of leather
and it was stuffed with plam fibres and at his feet were lying a heap of sant tree (acacia
niloctica, meant for dyeing) and near his head there was hanging a hide.And I saw
the marks of the maton the side of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him),
and so I wept.He said: What makes you weep? I said: Messenger of Allah, the
Khusrau and the Ceasars (spendd their lives in) the midst of (luxuries), whereas you
being Allah's Messenger (are leading your life in this poverty).Thereupon Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Don't you like that they should have riches
of their world, and you have the Hereafter.

Ibn 'Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported.I had always been
anxious to ask 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) about the two ladies amongst the
wives of Allah's Prophet (may peace be upon Lim) about whom Allah, the Exalted,
said: "If you both turn in repentance to Allah, then indeed your hearts are inclined
(to this)" (Ixvi. 4), until 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) set out for Hajj and I
also went along with him. And as we were going along a path, 'Umar (Allah be pleased
with hiyn) went aside and I also went aside with him with a jug (of water).He
answered the call of nature, and then came to me and I poured water over his hands
and he performed ablution I said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two ladies
amongst the wives of Allah's Prophet (may peace be upon him) about whom Allah,
the Exalted and Majestic, said: 'If you both turn to Allah in repentance, then indeed
your heart are inclined to it"? 'Umar (Allah he pleased with him) said: How strange
is it for you, Ibn 'Abbas! (Zuhri said: By Allah, he disliked what he asked about, but
did not keep it a secret.) He ('Umar) said: They are Hafsa and 'A'isha; and he then
began to narrate the hadith and said: We were such people among the Quraish who
dominated women, and as we reached Medina we found there people who were
dominated by their women, and our women began to learn (the habits) of their women.
He further said: And my house was situated in the suburb of Aledina in the tribe of
Banu Umayya b. Zaid.One day I became angry with my wife and she retorted upon
me. I did not like that she should retort upon me.She said: You disapprove of my
retorting upon you By Allah, the wives of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him)
retort upon him, and one of them detaches herself from him for the day until the
night.So I ('Umar) went out and visited Hafsa and said: Do you retort upon Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him)?She said: Yes.I said; Does any one of you
detach herself from him from the day to the night?She said: Yes.He said: She who
did like it amongst you in fact failed and incurred loss.Does everyone amongst you
not fear the wrath of Allah upon her due to the wrath of His Messenger (may peace be
upon him), and (as a result thereof) she may perish?So do not retort upon Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) and do not ask him for anything, but ask me that
which you desire, (and the frank behaviour) of your companion may not mislead you,
if she is more graceful and is dearer to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
than you (meaning 'A'isha) (Allah be pleased with her).He (Hadrat 'Umar further)
said: I had a compalaion from the Ansar and, we used to remain in the company of
the Messenger (may peace be upon him) turn by turn.He remained there for a day while
I remained there on the other day, and he brought me the news about the revelation
and other (matter), and I brought him (the news) like this.And we discussed that the
Ghassanids were shoeing the horses in order to attack us.Id y companion once attended
(the Apostle). and then came to me at night and knocked at my door and called me, and
I came out to him, and he said: A matter of great importance has happened. I said:
What is that?Have the Ghassanids come?He said: No, but even more serious and
more significant than that: the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has divorced
his wives.I said: Hafsa has failed and has incurred loss. and I feared that it would
happen.When it was dawn I observed the dawn prayer and dressed myself, and then
came there (in the house of the Holy Prophet) and visited Hafsa, and she was weeping. I
said: Has Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) divorced you (all)?She said: I do
not know.He has, however, separated himself in his attic. I came to a black servant and
said to him: Seek permission for 'Umar.He went in and then came to me and said: I
made mention of you to him, but he kept quiet. I then went to the pulpit and sat
there, and there was a group of people sitting by it and some of then were weeping.
I sat there for some time, until I was overpowered (by that very idea) which was in
my mind.I then came back to the boy and said to him: Seek permission for Umar.
He went in and came to me and said: I made mention of you to him but he kept
quiet.I was about to turn back when the boy called me and said: Go in; permission
has been granted to you.I went in and greeted Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) and he was reclining against the couch of mat and it had left its marks upon his
side. I said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives?He raised his head
towards me and said: No. I said: Allah is the Greatest.Messenger of Allah, I wish
if you had seen how we the people of Quraish had domination over women but
when we came to Medina we found people whom their women dominated. So our
women began to learn from their women.One dily I became angry with my wife
and she began to retort upon me. I did not approve that she should retort upon me.
She said: You do not like that I should retort upon you, but, by Allah. the wives of
Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) retort upon him and any one of them separates
herself from him for a day until night. I said: He who did that amongst them in fact
failed and incurred loss. Does any of them feel sate from the wrath of Allahupon her
due to the wrath of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), and she has certainly
perished.Allah's Messtnger (may peace be upon him) smiled, I said: Messenger of Allah,
I visited Hafsa and said: (The behaviour) of your companion ('A'isha) may not mislead
you, If she is more graceful than you and is dearer to Allah's Messenger (may peace
be upon him) than you.Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) smiled for the
second time.I said: Allah's Messenger, way I talk to you about agreeable things?He
said: Yes. I sat down and lifted my head (to see things) in the house and, by Allah,
I did not see anything significant besides three hides.I said: Messenger of Allah,
supplicate the Lord that He should make (life) prosperous for your Ummah as He has
made plentiful for the people of Persia and Rome (in spite of the fact) that they do
no, worship Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, whereupon he (Allah's Messenger) sat up
an I then said : Ibn Khattab, do you doubt that they are a nation whom their nice
things have been given immediately in the life of this world.I said: Allah's
Messenger! seek pardon for me.And he (Allah's Messenger) had taken an oath that
 he would not visit them for a month due to extreme annoyance with them until Allah
 showed His displeasure to him (Allah's Messenger).Zuhri said: 'Urwa informed me
 that 'A'Isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: When twenty-nine nights were over,
 Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me, and he began (his visit) with
 me. I said: Messenger of Allah, you had taken an oath that you would not visit us for
 a month, while you have visited after I have counted only twenty-nine (nights).
 Thereupon he said: The month may also be of twenty-nine (days).He then said:
 'A'isha, I am going to talk to you about a matter, and you should not be hasty in
 it (and do not give your final decision) until you have consulted your parents.He then
 recited this verse to me: "O Prophet, say to your wives" till he reached "mighty
 reward" (xxxiii. 28). 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: By Allah, he knew
 that my parents would not allow me to separate from him. I said: Is there any need
 to consult my parents in this matter? I in fact choose Allah and His Messenger (may
 peace be upon him) and the abode in the Hereafter.Ma'mar said: Ayyub reported to
 me that 'A'isha said: Don't inform your wives that I have chosen you, whereupon
 Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily Allah has sent me as a conveyer
 of message, and He has not sent me as a source of hardship (to others).Qatada said:

'Ubaidullah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utba reported that 'Amr b. Hafs b. al-Mughira
 set out along with 'Ali b. Abi Talib (Allah be pleased with him) to the Yemen and sent
 to his wife the one pronouncement of divorce which was still left from the (irrevocable)
 divorce; and he commanded al-Harith b. Hisham and 'Ayyash b. Abu Rabi'a to give
 her maintenance allowance.They said to her: By Allah, there is no maintenance allowance 
for you, except in case you are pregnant.She came to Allah's Apostle (may peace
 he upon him) and mentioned their opinion to him, whereupon he said: There is no
 maintenance allowance for you.Then she sought permission to move (to another place),
 and he (the Holy Prophet) permitted her.She said: Allah's Messenger, where (should I
 go)?He said: To the house of Ibn Umm Maktum and, as he is blind, she could put off
 her garmeqts in his presence and he would not see her.And when her 'Idda was over.
 Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her to Usama b. Zaid.Marwan (the
 governor of Medina) sent Qabisa b. Dhuwaib in order to ask her about this hadith,
 and she narrated it to him, whereupon Marwan said: We have not heard this hadith
 but from a woman.We would adopt a safe (path) where we found the people.Fatima
 said that when these words of, Marwan were conveyed to her.There is between me
 and you the word of Allah,the Exalted and Majestic: Do "not turn them out"of
 their houses.She asserted: This is in regard to the revocable divorce what new (turn
 can the event take) after three pronouncements (separation between irrevocable).Why
 do you say there is no maintenance allowance for her if she is not pregnant ? Then on
 what ground do you restrain her ?

Sa'id b Jubair reported: I was asked about the invokers of curses during
the reign of Mus'ab (b.Zubair) whether they could separate (themselves by this process).
He said: I did not understand what to say.So I went to the house of Ibn 'Umar
(Allah be pleased with them) in Mecca.I said to his servant: Seek permission for Me.
He said that he (Ibn 'Umar) had been taking rest.He (Ibn 'Umar) heard my voice. and
said: Are you Ibn Jubair?I said: Yes.He'said: Come in.By Allah, it must be some
(great) need which has brought you here at this Hour.So I got in and found him
lying on a blanket reclining against a pillow stuffed with fibres of date-palm. I said: O
Abu'Abd al-Rahman, should there be separation between the invokers of curses? He
said: Hallowed be Allah, yes,The first one who asked about it was so and so. he said:
Messenger of Allah, tell me If one of us finds his wife committing adultery: what
should he do?If he talks, that is something great, and if he keeps quiet that is also
(something great) (which he cannot afford to do).Allah's Prophet (may peace be upon
him) kept quiet (or some time). After some time he (that very person) came to him
(Allah's Messenger) and said: I have been involved in that very cage about which I
had asked you Allah the Exalted and Majestic then revealed (these) verses of Surah
Nur: "Those who accuse their wives" (verse 6), and he (the Holy Prophet) recited them
to him and admonished him, and exhorted him and informed him that the torment of
the world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter.He said: No, by Him
Who sent you with Truth, I did not tell a lie against her.He (the Holy Prophet) then
called her (the wife of that person who had accused her) and admonished her,
and exhorted her, and informed her that the torment of this world is less
painful than the torment of the Hereafter.She said: No, by Him Who sent thee
with Truth, he is a liar. (it was) the man who started the swearing of oath
and he swore in the name of Allah four times that he was among the truthful.
and at the fifth turn he said: Let there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among
the liars.Then the woman was called and she swore four times in the name of Allah
that he (her husband) was among the liars, and at the fifth time (she said): Let there
be curse upon her if he were among the truthful.He (the Holy Prophet) then effected
separation between the two.A hadith like this is narrated by Ibn Numair with a
