Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Permission (for entering the
house) should be sought three times and if permission is granted to you (then get in).
otherwise go back.  Ubayy b. Ka'b said: What is the iiiatter?  He said: I sought permission 
yesterday from 'Umar b. Khattab three times but he did not permit me, so I
came back; then I went to him today and visited him and informed him that I had
come to him yesterday and greeted him thrice, then came back, whereupon he said:
Yes, we did hear you but be were at that time busy, but why did you not seek permission 
(further and you must have never gone back until you were permitted to do so).  He
said: I sought permission (in the manner) that I heard  Allah's Messenger (may peace
be upon him) having said (in connection 'With the seeking of permission for entering
the house of a stranger).  Thereupon he (Hadrat Umar) said: By Allah, I shall torture
your back and your stomach unless you bring one who may bear witness to what you
state. 'Ubayy b. Ka'b said: By Allah, none should stand with you (to bear testimony)
but the youngest amongst us.  And he therefore, said to Abu Sa'id: Stand up. So I
stood up until I came to Umar and said: I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be
upon him) say this.

Abu Sa'id reported that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari came to the door of 'Umar
and sought his permission (to get into his house).  Umar said: That is once. He again
sought permission for the second time and 'Umar said: It is twice.  He again sought
permission for the third time and Umar said: It is thrice. He (Abu Musa) then
went back.  He (Hadrat 'Umar) (sent someone) to pursue him so that he should be
brought back.  Thereupon he (Hadrat Umar) said: If this act (of yours is in accordance
with the command of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) you have preserved
in your mind, then it is all right, otherwise (I shall give you such a severe punishment)
that it will serve as an example to others.  Abu Sa'id said: Then he (Abu Musa) came
to us and said: Do you remember Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) having
said this: "Permission is for three times"?  They (Companions sitting in that cothpany)
began to laugh, whereupon he (Abu Musa) said: There comes to you your Muslim
brother who had been perturbed and you laugh.  Abu Sa'id said: (Well), you go forth.
I shall be your participant in this trouble of yours.  So he came to him (Hadrat Umar)
and said: Here is Abu Sa'id (to support my statement).

'Ubaid b. Umair reported that Abu Musa brought permission from Umar
(to enter the house) three times, and finding him busy came back, whereupon Umar
said (to the Inmates of his house): Did you not hear the voice of 'Abdullah b. Qais
(the Kunya of Abu Musa Ash'ari) ? He was called back. and he (Hadrat 'Umar) said:
What did prompt you to do it?  Thereupon, he said: This is how we have been commanded 
to act.  He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: Bring evidence (in support of) it, otherwise
I shall deal (strictly) with you.  So he (Abu Musa) set out and came to the meeting of
the Ansar and asked them to bear witness before hadrat Umar about this.  They (the
Companions present there) said: None but the youngest amongst us would bear out
this fact.  So Abu Sa'id Khudri (who was the youngest one in that company) said: We
have been commanded to do so (while visiting the house of other people).  Thereupon
'Umar said: This command of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had remained
hidden from me up till now due to (my) business in the market.

Abu Musa, what made you go back, while we were busy in some work?  He said: I
heard Allah's Messenger (may.peace be upon him) as saying: Permission should be
sought thrice.  And if you are permitted, (then get in), otherwise go back.  He said:
Bring witness to this fact, otherwise I shall do this and that, i.e. I shall punish you.
Abu Musa went away and 'Umar said to him (on his departure): It he (Abu Musa) finds
a witness he should meet him by the side of the pulpit in the evening and it he does
not find a witness you would not find him there.  When it was evening he (Hadrat

been able to find a witness to what you have said?  He said: Yes.  Here is Ubayy bin

of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), whereupon he Hadrat 'Umar said:
Hallowed be Allah.  I had heard something (in this connection), but I wished it to be
