INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
   A bequest (WasIyya) or will is defined as a transfer to come into operation after
   the testator's death.  The testator is called Musi, and the legatee or devisee is called
   Musa lahu, and the executor is called Wasi.  It is a spiritual testament of a man enabling
   him to make up his shortcomings in the worldly life and securing rewards in the
   Hereafter.
</p>
<p>  
   According to the Shar'iah, one is entitled to make a will for one-third of one's
   property and not beyond that so that the rights of the legal heirs are not adversely
   affected.
</p>
<p>
   "Again, the principle on which the legality of a testamentary disposition is based
   being in defeance pro tanto of the rights of heirs generally the law requires that such
   disposition should be for the benefit of non-heirs alone.
</p>
<p>
   "A further reason why a bequest in favour of an heir is not allowed is that it
   would amount to giving preference to some heirs over others, thus defeating the spirit
   of the law which has fixed the portion of each in the inheritance and causing disputes
   among persons related to one another.  If the other heirs consent to a bequest to one
   of them or to a bequest of more than one-third of the estate, the above reasons no
   longer hold good and the bequest as made will be valid" (Abdur Rahim, The Principles
   of Muhammadan jurisprudence, pp. 311-2).
</p>
<p>
   It is, however, preferable and most advisable not to will away the property if the
   legal heirs are poor, because it manifests benevolence to the heirs who have superior
   claim to it from the relations in which they stand.
</p>
<p>
   Another principle which is observed in case of bequest is that the proprietary right
   of a legatee in a bequest is establislied if he accepts it.

       Amir b. Sa'd reported on the authority of his father (Sa'd b. Abi
       Waqqas): Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me in my illness which
       brought me near death in the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada' (Farewell Pilgrimage).  I said:
       Allah's Messenger, you can well see the pain with which I am afflicted and I am a man
       possessing wealth, and there is none to inherit me except only one daughter.  Should I
       give two-thirds of my property as Sadaqa ? He said: No. I said: Should I give half (of
       my property) as Sadaqa?  He said: No. He (further) said: Give one-third (in charity)
       and that is quite enough.  To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them
       poor, begging from people; that you would never incur an expense seeking therewith
       the pleasure of Allah, but you would be rewarded therefor, even for a morsel of food
       that you put in the mouth of your wife.  I said: Allah's Messenger. would I survive my
       companions?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: If you survive them, then do such a deed by
       means of which you seek the pleasure of Allah, but you would increase in your status
       (in religion) and prestige;  you may survive so that people would benefit from you,
       and others would be harmed by you. (The Holy Prophet) further said: Allah,
       complete for my Companions their migration, and not cause them to turn back
       upon their heels.  Sa'd b. Khaula is, however, unfortunate.  Allah's Messenger (may
       peace be upon him) felt grief for him as he had died in Mecca.

     migrated as Sa'd b. Khaula had died.  Thereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon

     only one daughter as my inheritor.  Should I not will away the whole of my property ?
     He (the Holy Prophet) said : No. He said: (Should I not will away,) two-thirds of the
     property ? he (the Holy Prophet) said: No. He (Sa'd) (again) said : (Should I not will

     he (the Holy Prophet) said : (Yes), one-third, and one-third is quite substanial.  And
     what you spend as charity from your property is Sadaqa and flour spending on your
     family is also Sadaqa, and what your wife eats from your property is also Sadaqa, and
     that you leave your heirs well off (or he said : prospreous) is better than to leave them
     (poor and) begging from people.  He (the Holy Prophet) pointed this with his hands.
