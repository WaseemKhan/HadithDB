INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
Marriage is a social institution as old as the human race itself.It may be defined
as a relation between a man and a woman which is recognised by custom or law and
involves certain rights and duties, both in the case of the parties entering the Union,
and in case of the children born of it.Marriage has thus two main functions to perform:
it is the means adopted by human society for regulating relations between the sexes;
and it furnishes the mechanism by means of which the relations of a child to the community 
is determined.</p>
<p> 
The rites and ceremonies of marriage have been different with different peoples 
and in different ages.but these two functions mentioned above are common even
where in marriage.It always implies the right of sexual intercourse as allowed and
recognised by society and the duties of the parents in bringing up children.</p>
<p>Islam recognises this institution and accepts it as the basis of human society after
purging it of all those evils which had penetrated it.</p>
<p>
Firstly, Islam does not regard it as a union only for the gratification of sexual
lost, but a social contract with wide and varied responsibilities and duties.The reason
behind it is that, according to the Divine Faith, a woman is not a plaything in the
hand of man. but a spiritual and moral being who is entrusted to him on the sacred
pledge to which Allah is made a witness.The wife is, therefore, not meant. to provide
sensuous pleasure only to the male, but to fully co-operate with him in making the life
of the family and ultimately of the whole humanity significantly meaningful.</p>
<p>The Holy Qur'an has in so many verses pointed out the different purposes of
marriage.It states: "And of His signs is that He has created wives for you from yourselves 
that you might find quiet of wind in them, and He put between you love and
affection" (xxx. 21).In this verse it has been said that the female is not inferior to
the male in the sense that the former is created out of a superior stuff while the latter
comes of a base origin.Both man and woman are the progeny of Adam and thus both
have the same soul.The purpose of marriage, according to the Holy Qur'an, is therefore, 
the union of the two souls which are one in essence.Their separate existence is
an unnatural state of their being which changes Into the natural state when they are
united by marriage and thus are brought close to each other physically, mentally and
emotionally.</p>
<p>
Both man and woman are the joint heirs of the grace of life, and unless there
is a very close and intimate form of companionship in them, they cannot enjoy the true
grace of life. "He it is Who created you from a single soul, and of the same did He
make his spouse, that he might find comfort in her" (vii. 189)."Comfort" implies
much more than a mere sexual gratification.It is not too much to say that the whole
conception of the marriage relation in Islam is charged with spiritual and moral ideas,
and must of necessity elevate the status of matrimonial alliance in the individual and
social life.</p>
<p>
 In Islam the union of the sexes has been purified and the joy of the married
relation secured by the absolute prohibition of every kind of extra-matzimonial 
connection.The Holy Qur'an stresses upon the people to marry as it is the most effective
means whereby one can lead a virtuous life free from immorality and emotional inhibition.
The Holy Qur'an says: "They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are
as a garment to them" (ii. 187).The mutual relation of husband and wife is here
described in words which could not be surpassed in beauty.Herein is the correct 
description of the relationship between the two.The husband and the wife are for mutual
support, mutual comfort and mutual protection, fitting into each other as garments fit
into each other.</p>
<p>
Then the Holy Qur'an also makes it clear that this union is not a temporary relationship 
between two individuals of opposite sexes: It is a permanent and enduring
relationship in the sense that both the parties should put in their earnest endeavours to
lead their lives in perfect harmony and acquitting themselves creditably of the 
responsibilities saddled upon them by entering into this sacred contract.</p>
<p>
The Holy Qur'an farther points out that sexual gratification in the married life is
not meant only for the satisfaction of the physical lust, but it mustbe directed to
some higher ends."Your women are tilth for you, so go into your tilth as ye like, and
provide beforehand for your souls, and fear Allah and know that you are going to meet
Him" (iii. 223).Here the wives are likened to the cultivable land which are ploughed for
sowing and reaping the produce (in the form of offspring) and not merely for carnal
indulgence.The concluding part of the verse refers to still higher and sublimer ends
which tell that even in the height of carnal pleasures the moral and spiritual responsibilities 
should not in any way be lost sight of ; rather one should be more conscious
to them when one is enjoying physical pleasures as these are the moments when the
fear of the Lord and the accountability in the Hereafter is likely to be blurred or
effaced from one's mind.

Khaibar (and we rode so close to each other in the street) that my knee touched
the leg of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him). (A part of the) lower garment

work, and said: By Allah, Muhammad (has come).Abd al-'Aziz or some of our com-
panions said: Muhammad and the army (have come).He said: We took it (the territory
of Khaibar) by force, and there were gathered the prisoners of war.There came Dihya
and he said: Messenger of Allah, bestow upon me a girl ont of the prisones. He
said: Go and get any girl.He made a choice for Safiyya daughter of Huyayy (b.
 Akhtab).There came a person to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said:
 Apostle of Allah, you have bestowed Safiyya bint Huyayy, the chief of Quraiza and
 al-Nadir, upon Dihya and she is worthy of you only.He said: Call him along with
 her.So he came along with her.When Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) saw

 He (the Holy Prophet) then granted her emancipation and married her.Thabit said to

Anas (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was sitting behind Abu
 Talha on the Day of Khaibar and my feet touched the foot of Allah's Messenger (may
 peace be upon him), and we came (to the people of Khaibar) when the sun had risen
 and they had driven out their cattle, and had themselves come out with their axes,
 large baskets and hatchets, and they said: (Here come) Muhammad and the army.
 Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Khaibar is ruined.Verily when we
 get down in the valley of a people, evil is the morning of the warned ones (al-Qur'an,
 xxxvii. 177).Allah, the Majestic and the Glorious, defeated them (the inhabitants of
 Khaibar), and there fell to the lot of Dihya a beautiful girl, and Allah's Messenger
 (may peace be upon him) got her in exchange of seven heads, and then entrusted her to
 Umm Sulaim so that she might embellish her and prepare her (for marriage) with him.
 He (the narrator) said: He had been under the impression that he had said that so that
 she might spend her period of 'Iddah in her (Umm Sulaim's) house. (The woman) was
 Safiyya daughter of Huyayy.Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) arranged the
 wedding feast consisting of dates, cheese, and refined butter, and pits were dug and tiers
 were set in them dining cloths, and there was brought cheese and refined butter,
 and these were placed there.And the people ate to their fill, and they said: We do not
know whether he (the Holy Prophet) had married her (as a free woman), or as a slave
woman.They said: If he (the Holy Prophet) would make her wear the veil, then she
would be a (free married) woman, and if he would not make her wear the veil, then
she should be a slave woman.When he intended to ride, he made her wear the veil
and she sat on the hind part of the camel; so they came to know that he had married
her.As they approached Medina, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) drove
(his ride) quickly and so we did.'Adba' (the name of Allah's Apostle's camel) stumbled
and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) fell down and she (Radrat Safiyya:
also fell down.He (the Holy Prophet) stood up and covered her. woman looked
towards her and said: May Allah keep away the Jewess! He (the narrator) said: I
said: Aba Hamza, did Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) really fall down?
He said: Yes, by Allah, he in fact fell down.Anas said: I also saw the wedding feast
of Zainab, and he (the Holy Prophet) served bread and meat to the people, and made
them eat to their heart's content, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent me to call people,
and as he was free (from the ceremony) he stood up and I followed him.Two persons
were left and they were busy in talking and did not get out (of the apartment).He
(the Holy Prophet) then proceeded towards (the apartments of) his wives.He greeted
with as-Salamu 'alaikum to every one of them and said: Members of the household, how
are you? They said: Messenger of Allah, we are in good state 'How do you find your
family?He would say: In good state.When he was free from (this work of exchanging
greetings) he came back, and I also came back along with him.And as he reached the
door, (he found) that the two men were still busy in talking.And when they saw him
having returned, they stood up and went out; and by Allah ! I do not know whether I
had informed him, or there was a revelation to him (to the affect) that they had gone.
He (the Holy Prophet) then came back and I also returned along with him, and as he
put his step on the threshold of his door he hung a curtain between me and him, and
(it was on this occasion) that Allah revealed this verse: ("O you who believe), do not
enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to 'you" (xxxiii. 53).
