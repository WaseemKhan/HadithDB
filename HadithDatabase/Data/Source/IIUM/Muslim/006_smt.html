INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
After prayer the second obligatory duty which every Muslim is required toper-
form is that of fasting during the month of Ramadan.  The word sawm which has been
used in the Holy Qur'an and the Hadith for fasting means "to abstain"; thus a horse
that abstains from moving about or from eating the fodder is said to be sa'im.  In the
technical language sawm signifies fasting or abstaining from food and drink and sexual
intercourse from the dim beginning of dawn till sunset.
<p>
Fasting as an institution for the purification of the soul is common to all Divine
religions.  The writer of the article on "Fasting" in the Encyclopadia Britannica states
that "it would be difficult to name any religious system of any description in which it
is wholly unrecognized." This institution was well established among the Jews and
the Christians.
<p>
The records of the Hadith bear ample testimony to the fact that fasting was a
common religious practice among the pre-Islamic Arabs too, and they used to observe
fast on the tenth of Muharram because it was on this very day that Allah saved Moses
and his companions from the clutches of the Pharaoh who was drowned in the sea
along with his army.  The Arabs and other people too were familiar with fasting as an
act of penitence or of propitiation or a preparatory rite before some act of sacramental
eating or an initiation or a mourning ceremony.
<p>
In Islam fasting is primarily an institution for a spiritual discipline and 
selfcontrol.  It is in fact an exercise in religious devotion in the form of cheerful and 
willing renunciation, for a definite period, of all the appetites of flesh lawful in themselves
(the unlawful ones being ruled out of course).  The Qur'an says:
<blockquote>
<p>
     0 ye who believe ! prescribed unto you is fasting even as it was prescribed
   unto those before you. that haply you may become God-conscious
   (ii. 183).
</blockquote>
<p>
Of all the creation of God only man deviates from His path.  We will find that two
things are mainly responsible for this: the love for material possessions and the tempta-
tions of the flesh.  Islam has, through the institutions of Zakat and Sadaqat, purged the
hearts of its followers from the love of wealth, and has inculcated in him the habit to
part with it readily for the sake of God.
<p>
Fasting has been ordained as a religious duty for the Muslims for subduing their
lust and keeping their appetites well within reasonable bounds so that man may not
become their slave and lose control over himself.  The Qur'an clearly states that a man
cannot attain salvation unless he learns to restrain his self from low desires.  "And as
for him who fears to stand before his Lord and restrains himself from low desires,
Paradise is surely the abode" (lxxix. 40-41).
<p>
The exercise of abstaining from things otherwise lawful in the ordinary course of
life, at the behest of Allah, strengthens man's morality and self-control and deepens in
him the consciousness of the Lord.  This is what distinguishes fasting in Islam from
fasting in other religions.
<p>
It should also be borne in mind that fasting does not aim at inflicting punishment
upon people or sadding upon them unbearable burdens.  The underlying idea behind
it is to teach moderation and spiritual discipline so that human temptations may not
become so wild and uncontrollable as to flout the commands of the Great Master.  To
be a true servant of Allah, it is essential that man should be able to conform his
behaviour to the moral and spiritual discipline embodied in the Shari'ah of Islam.
One cannot achieve this end if one finds oneself helpless before untamed and turbulent
desires.  Fasting is indispensable for this moral and spiritual training.
<p>
Another distinguishing feature of Islamic fasting is that it does not train a person
for complete renunication but for perfect and cheerful obedience to the Lord All those
things from which man is commanded to abstain during fast, e.g. eating, drinking and
sexual intercourse, become permissible for him at the end of the fast.  This shows that
Islam does not look down upon the appetite of flesh as something ignoble and thus fit
to be exterminated root and branch from the human soul.  According to Islam, there is
nothing profane or ignoble in human personality: both soul and body are sacred and
worthy of respect.  No aspect is to be ignored and no urge is to be completely curbed.
What is required is to keep all these urges well within their proper limits so that
none of them transgresses natural bounds and becomes the source of trouble.
<p>
 That fasting is an institution for moral elevation can be judged from the fact that
Allah does not impose check only upon eating, drinking and sexual intercourse from
dawn to sunset, but also exhorts His servants to refrain from other foul acts, for ex-
ample, backbiting, indulging in foul speech, telling lies, etc.  Abu Huraira reported
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying : If one does not abandon falsehood 
and other actions like it, God has no need that one should abandon one's food
and drink (Sahih Bukhari).
<p>    
The social aspect of fasting in Ramadan is that the whole atmosphere is permeated
with religious piety and devotion to Allah.  There is one extra congregational prayer,
Tarawih, during the night, in which the Qur'an is recited and the Muslim is reminded
of the fact that it was in the month of Ramadan that the revelation of the Qur'an
commenced.  The sadaqqt are also given with greater zeal and fervour in this month.
Thus the whole Muslim society is inspired by the love of God.  Abu Huraira reported
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When Ramadan begins, the
gates of Heaven are opened, the gates of Hell are locked, and the devils are chained
(Bukhari and Muslim).
<p>    
Muhammad Asad, while elucidating the spiritual and moral significance of fast
says: "Twofold I learned, is the purpose of this month of fasting.  One has to abstain
from food and drink in order to feel in one's body what the poor and hungry feel :thus
social responsibility is being hammered into human consciousness as a religious postulate.  
The other purpose of fasting during Ramadan is self-discipline, an aspect of individual 
morality strongly accentuated in all Islamic teachings (as, for instance, in the
total prohibition of all intoxicants, which Islam regards as too easy an avenue of escape
from consciousness and responsibility).  In these two elements-brotherhood of man
and Individual self-discipline -I began to discern nhe outline of Islam's ethical out
look" (Road to Mecca, London, 1954, p. 188).

white streak is distinct from the dark streak," a person would take hold of a white
thread and a black thread and keep on eating till he could find them distinct (in the
light of the dawn).  It was then that Allah, the Majestic and Great, reveiled (the
words) min al-fajr (from the dawn), and then it became clear (that the word khait
refers to the streak of light in the dawn).

Abu Bakr (he is Abu Bakr b. Abd al-Rahman b. Harith) reported: I heard
Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) narrating that he who is overtaken
by dawn in a state of seminal emission should not observe fast.  I made a 
mention of it to 'Abd al-Rahman b. Harith (i.e. to his father) but he denied it.  
'Abd al-Rahman went and I also went along with him till we came to'A'isha and Umm Salama
(Allah be pleased with both of them) and Abd al-Rahman asked them about it.
Both of them said: (At times it so happened) that the Apostle of  Allah (may peace
be upon him) woke up in the morning in a state of junub (but without seminal 
emission in a dream)  and observed fast He (the narrator) said: We then proceeded till
we went to Marwan and Abd al-Rahman made a mention of it to him.  Upon this
Marwan said: I stress upon you (with an oath) that you better go to Abu Huraira and
refer to him what is said about it.  So we came to Abu Huraira and Abu Bakr had
been with us throughout and 'Abd al-Rahman made a mention of it to him, whereupon
Abu Huraira said: Did they (the two wives of the Holy Prophet) tell you this? He
replied: Yes Upon this (Abu Huraira) said: They have better knowledge.  Abu Huraira
then attributed that what was said about it to Fadl b. 'Abbas and said: I heard it
from Fadl and not from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him).  Abu Huraira
then retracted from what he used to say about it.  Ibn Juraij (one of the narrators)
reported: I asked 'Abd al-Malik, if they (the two wives) said (made the statement) in
regard to Ramadan, whereupon he said: It was so, and he (the Holy Prophet) (woke up
in the) morning in a state of junub which was not due to the wet dream and then
observed fast.

hardships for a long time), and I accepted that which the Apostle of Allah (may peace
be upon him) had told me.  When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the conces-
sion (granted by) the Apostle of Allah (may-peace be upon him).  This hadith has been
narrated by Yahya b. Abu Kathir with the same chain of transmitters and he made this
addition after these words: During every month, (fasting) for three days, there is for you
ten times for every good and that is perpetual fasting (for three days would bring a
reward for full thirty days).  I said: What is the fast of the Apostle of Allah, David?  He
said: Half of the age (observing fast on alternate days for the whole life).  And in the
hadith no mention has been made of the recital of the Qur'an, and he did not say: Your
visitor has a right upon you, but (instead) he said: Your son has a right upon you.

your eyes, share for your own self, share for your family; so observe fast and break
it, pray and sleep and observe fast for one day during the ten days, and there is a
reward for you (for other) nine (days besides the tenth day of the fast). I said: Apostle

He (the Holy Prophet) said: He used to fast one day and break it on the other day,

'Ata', the narrator of the hadith, said: I do not know how there (crept in) the matter of

fast at all, he who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all.  This hadith has been

and I (saw in the dream) that I was prostrating in the morning in clay and water.  So
in the morning of the twenty-first night when he (the Holy Prophet) got up for dawn
(prayer). there was a rainfall and the mosque dripped, and I saw clay and water.  When
he came out after completing the morning prayer (I saw) that his forehead and the tip
of his nose had (traces) of clay and water, and that was the twenty-first night among
the last ten (nights).

Abu Salama reported:'We discussed amongst ourselves Lailat-ul-Qadr.  I
came to Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) who was a friend of mine
and said to him: Would you not go with us to the garden of date trees?  He went out
with a cloak over him.  I said to him: Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (may peace
be upon him) making mention of Lailat-ul-Qadr?  He said: Yes, (and added) we were
observing i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the middle
ten days of Ramadan, and came out on the morning of the twentieth and the Messenger 
of Allah (may peace be upon him) addressed us and said: I was shown 
Lailat-ul-Qadr, but I forgot (the exact night) or I was caused to forget it, 
so seek it in the last
ten odd (nights), and I was shown that I was prostrating in water and clay.  So he who
wanted to observe i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (inay peace be upon him) should
return (to the place of i'tikaf).  He (Abu Sa'id al-Khudri) said: And we returned and
did not find any patch of cloud in the sky.  Then the cloud gathered and there was (so
heavy) a downpour that the roof of the mosque which was made of the branches of
date-palms began to drip.  Then there was prayer and I saw the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) prostrating in water and clay till I saw the traces of clay on
his forehead.

 Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger
of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed i'tikaf in the middle ten days of Ramadan
to seek Lailat-ul-Qadr  before it was made manifest to him.  When (these nights) were
over, he commanded to strike the tent.  Then it was made manifest to him that 
(Lailat-ul-Qadr) was in the last ten nights (of Ramadan), and commanded to pitch the tent
(again).  He then came to the people and said: O people, Lailat-ul-Qadr was made
manifest to me and I came out to inform you about it that two persons came contend-
ing with each other and there was a devil along with them and I forgot it.  So seek it
in the last ten nights of Ramadan.  Seek it on the ninth, on the seventh and on the
fifth.  I (one of the narrators) said: Abu Sa'id, you know more than us about numbers.
He said: Yes, indeed we have better right than you.  I said: What is this ninth,
seventh, and fifth?  He said: When twenty-one (nights are over) and the twenty-second
begins, it is the ninth, and when twenty-three (nights) are over, that which follows
(the last night) is the seventh, and when twenty-five nights are over, what follows it
is fifth. Ibn Khallad said: Instead of the word Yahliqan (contending), he said
Yakhtasiman, (they are disputing).

throughout the year would find Lailat-ul-Qadr, whereupon he said: May Allah have
mercy upon him; (he said these words) with the intention that people might not rely
only (on one night), whereas he knew that it (Lailat-ul-Qadr) is in the month of
Ramadan and it is the twenty-seventh night.  He then took oath (without making any
exception, i.e. without saying Innsha Allah) that it was the twenty-seventh night. I
said to him: Abu Mundhir, on what ground do you say that?  Thereupon he said: By
the indication or by the sign which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)
gave us, and that is that on that day (the sun) would rise without having any ray in it.
