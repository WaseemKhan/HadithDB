Abd Shuraib al-Adawi reported: My eare listened and my eye saw
when Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) spoke and said: He who believes
In Allah and the eireafter should show respect to the guest even with utmost
kindness and courtesy.  They said: Messenger of Allah, what is this utmost kindness
and courtesy?  He replied: It is for a day and a night.  Hospitality extends for three
days, and what is beyond that is a Sadaqa for him; and he who believes in Allah and
the Hereafter should say something good or keep quiet.

Abu Shuriah al-Khuza'i reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) as saying: (The period of the entertainment of a guest is three days, and utmost
kindness and courtesy is for a day and a night.=" It is not permissible for a Muslim
to stay with, his brother until he makes him sinful. They said: Messenger of Allah,
how he would make him sinful?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: He stays with him (so
long) that nothing is left with him to entertain him.

this: "It is not permissible for any one of you to stay with his brother until he makes
him sinful."

'Uqba b. Amir reported: We said to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him): You send us out and we come to the people who do not give us hospitality, so
what is your opinion?  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If
you come to the people who order for you what is befitting a guest, accept it; but if
they do not. take from them what befits them to give to a guest.

Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: While we were with the Apostle of Allah
(may peace be upon him) on a journey, a person came upon his mount and began to
stare on the right and on the left, (it was at this moment) that Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him) said: He who has an extra mount should give that to one who
has no mount for him, and he who has surplus of provisions should give them to
him who has no provisions, and he made mention of so many kinds of wealth until we
were of the opinion that none of us has any right over the surplus.

Iyas b. Salama reported on the authority of his father: We set out on an
expedition with,  Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him).  We facts hardship (in
getting provisions) until we decided to slaughter some of our riding animals.  Allah's
Apostle (may peace be upon him), commanded us to pool our provisions of food.  So we
spread a sheet of leather and the provisions of the people were collected on it. I
stretched myself to measure how much that was (the length and, breadth of the sheet
on which the provisions were laid).  I measured it and (found) that it was (in length
and breadth) of (so much size) on which a goat could sit.  We were fourteen hudnred
persons.  We (all) ate until we were fully satisfied and then filled our bags with
provisions.  Then Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Is there any water for
performing ablution.  Then there came a man with a small bucket containing some
water.  He threw it in a basin.  We all fourteen hundred persons performed ablution
using the water in plenty.  Then there came after that eight persons and they said: Is
there any water to perform ablution?  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be
upon him) said: The ablution has already been performed.
