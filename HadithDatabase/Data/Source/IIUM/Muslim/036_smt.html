Usama b. Zaid reported that Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him)
said: I stood at the door of Paradise and I found that the overwhelming majority of
those who entered therein was that of poor persons and the wealthy persons were
detained to get into that.  The denizens of Hell were commanded to get into Hell, and
I stood upon the door of Fire and the majority amongst them who entered there was
that of women.

verily, the first trial for the people of Isri'll was caused by women.  And in the hadith

MAKING GOOD DEEDS OF THEIRS AS THE MEANS OF RIDDANCE

<p>
'Abdullah b. 'Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) said: Three persons set out on a journey.  They were overtaken by rain and
they had to find protection in a mountain cave where at its mouth there fell a rock of
that mountain and thus blocked them altogether.  One of them said to the others:
Look to your good deeds that you performed for the sake of Allah and then supplicate 
Allah, the Exalted, that He might rescue you (from this trouble).  One of them
said: 0 Allah, I had my parents who were old and my wife and my small children
also. I tended the flock and when I came back to them in the evening, I milked them
(the sheep, goats, cows, etc.) and first served that milk to my parents.  One day I was
obliged to go out to a distant place in search of fodder and I could not come back
before evening and found them (the parents) asleep.  I milked the animals as I used to
milk and brought milk to them and stood by their heads avoiding to disturb them
from sleep and I did not deem it advisable to serve milk to my children before serving 
them.  My children wept near my feet.  I remained there in that very state and my
parents too until it was morning.  And (0 Allah) if Thou art aware that I did this in order
to seek Thine pleasure, grant us riddance from this trouble. (The rock slipped a bit)
that they could see the sky.  The second one said: 0 Allah, I had a female cousin whom
I loved more than the men love the women.  I wanted to have sexual intercourse with
her; she refused but on the condition of getting one hundred dinirs.  It was with
very great difficulty that I could collect one hundred dinirs and then paid them to her
and when I was going to have a sexual intercourse with her, that she said: Servant of
Allah, fear Allah and do not break the seal (of chastity) but by lawful means.  I got up.
0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, rid us from
this trouble.  The situation was somewhat eased for them.  The third one said : Allah,
I employed a workman for a measure of rice.  After he had finished his work I gave
him his dues (in the form of) a measure of rice, but he did not accept them.  I used
these rice as seeds ,and that gave a bumper crop and I became rich enough to have
cows and flocks (in my possession).  He came to me and said: Fear Allah, and commit
no crueltv upon me in regard to my dues. I said to him : Takeaway this flock of cows
and sheep.  He said: Fear Allah and do not make a fun of me. I said: I am not making 
a fun of you.  You take the cows and the flocks.  So he took them. 0 Allah, if Thou
art aware that I did it for Thine pleasure, case the situation for us.  And Allah 
relieved them from the rest of the trouble.

Abdullah b 'Umar reported: I heard Allah's Alessenger (may peace be
upon him) as saying: Three persons belonging to the earlier Ummahs set out on a
journey until they had to spend a night in a cave.  The rest of the hadith is the same
and the additional words are: "A person amongst them said: 0 Allah, I had my aged
parents and I served them milk before I (served that) to my wife, children and my
servants." And in case of the second one, the words are: "She avoided me until she was
hard pressed because of famine and she came to me and I gave her one hundred
and twenty diiiirs " And in cease of the third one (the words are) : "I invested his
wages, and it brought profit and, as a result thereof, the merchandise increased and
there was abundance of goods." And he (the narrator said) that they got out of the
cave and began to walk.
