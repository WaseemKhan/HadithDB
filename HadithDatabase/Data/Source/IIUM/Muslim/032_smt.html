Again it is your mother (who deserves the best treatment from you).  He said: Then

said: Then who?  Thereupon he said: Then it is your father.  In the hadith transmitted

Abu Huraira reported that Juraij was one who was devoted to (prayer) in
the temple.  His mother came to him.  Humaid said that Abu Rafi' demonstrated
before us like the demonstration made by abu Huraira to whom Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him) had demonstrated as his mother called him placing her palms
upon the eyebrows and lifting her head for calling him and said: Juraij, it is your
mother, so talk to her.  She found him at that time absorbed in prayer, so he said (to
himself): O Lord, my mother (is calling me) (whereas I am absorbed) in my prayer.  He
opted for prayer.  She (his mother) went back, then came again for the second time
and said: O Juraij, it is your mother (calling you), so talk to me.  He said: O Allah.
there is my mother also and my prayer, and he opted for prayer.  She said: O Allah, this
Juraij is my son.  I pray to talk to him but he refuses to talk to me. O Allah, don't
bring death to him unless he has seen the prostitutes, and had she invoked the curse
upon him (from the heart of her heart) he would have been involved in some turmoil.
There was a shepherd living near by his temple (the temple where Juraij was engaged
in prayer).  It so happened that a woman of that village came there and that shepherd
committed fornication with her and she became pregnant and gave birth to a child.
It was said to her: Whose child is this?  She said: He is the child of one who is living
in this temple.  So there came persons with hatchets and spades.  They called Juraij.
He was absorbed in prayer and he did not talk to them and they were about to demolish 
that temple that he saw them and then came to them and they said: Ask her (this
woman) what she says.  He smiled and then touched the head of the child and said:
Who is your father?  He (the child) said: My father is the shepherd of the sheep, and
when they heard this, they said: We are prepared to rebuild with gold and silver what
we have demolished from your temple.  He said: No, rebuild it with clay as it had
been before.  He then went up (to his room and absorbed himself in prayer).

<p>
Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying:
None spoke in the cradle but only three (persons), Christ son of Mary, the second one
the companion of Juraij. Juraij had got constructed a temple and confined himself in
that.  His mother came to him as he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij.  He said:
My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in) my prayer.  He continued
with the prayer.  She returned and she came on the next day and he was busy in
prayer, and she said: Juraij.  And he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I
 am engaged) in prayer, and he continued with the prayer and she went back, and then
 on the next day she again came and he was busy in prayer and she said: Juraij.  And
 he said: My Lord, my mother (is calling me while I am engaged in my prayer, and he
 continued with the prayer, and she said: My Lord, don't give him death unless he has
 seen the fate of the prostitutes.  The story of Juraij and that of his meditation and
 prayer gained currency amongst Bani Isra'il.  There was a prostitute who had been a
 beauty incarnate.  She said (to the people): If you like I can allure him to evil.  She
 presented herself to him but he paid no heed (to her).  She came to a shepherd who lived
 near the temple and she offered herself to him and he had a sexual intercourse with her
 and so she became pregnant arid when she gave birth to a child she said: This is
 from Juraij.  So they came and asked him to get down and demolished the temple and
 began to beat him.  He said: What is the matter?  They said: You have committed
 fornication with this prostitute and she has given birth to a child from your loins.
 He said: Where is the child ? They brought him (the child) and he said: just leave
 me so that I should observe prayer.  And he observed prayer and when he finished, he
 came to the child.  He struck his stomach and said: O boy, who is your father? lie
 said: He is such shepherd.  So they turned towards Juraij, kissed him and touched
 him (for seeking blessing) and said: We are prepared to construct your temple with
 gold.  He said.  No, just rebuild it with mud as it had been, and they did that.  Then
 there was a babe who was sucking his mother that a person dressed in fine garment
 came riding upon a beast.  His mother said: O Allah, make my child like this one.
 He (the babe) left sucking and began to see towards him, and said: O Allah, don't
 make me like him.  He then returned to the chest and began to suck the milk of his
 mother.  He (Abu Huraira) said: I perceived as if I am seeing Allah's Messenger (may
 peace be upon him) as he is explaining the scene of his sucking milk with his forefinger
 in his mouth and sucking that.  He (Abu Huraira) further reported Allah's Apostle
 (may be peace upon him) as saying: There happened to pass by him a girl who was being
 beaten and they were saying: You have committed adultery and you have committed
 theft and she was saying: Allah is enough for me and He is my good Protector, and his
 mother said: O Allah, don't make my child like her and he left sucking the milk, and
 looked towards her and said: O Allah, make me like her, and there was a talk between
 them.  She said: O with shaven head, a good-looking person happened to pass by and I
 said: O Allah, make my child like him, and you said: O Allah, don't make me like
 him, and they passed by a girl while they were beating her and saying: You committed
 fornication and you committed theft, and I said: O Allah, don't make my child like
 her, and you said: O Allah, make me like her.  Thereupon he said: That person was a
 tyrant, and I said: O Allah, don't make me like him, and they were saying about her:
 You committed fornication whereas in fact she had not committed that and they were
 saying: You have committed theft whereas she had not committed theft, so I said:
 O Allah, make me like her.

saying: Do you know what is backbiting?  They (the Companions) said: Allah and His
Messenger know best.  Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Backbiting implies your
talking about your brother in a manner which he does not like.  It was said to him:
What is your opinion about this that if I actually find (that failing) in my brother
which I made a mention of ? He said: If (that failing) is actually found (in him) what
you assert, you in fact backbited him, and if that is not in him it is a slander.

Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
said to a woman of the Ansar: In case anyone amongst you sees the sad demise of
three children of (hers) and she resigns herself to the will of God hoping to get reward,
she would be admitted to Paradise.  A woman from amongst them said: Allah's Messenger,
even if they (the children who die) are two.  Thereupon, he (the Holy Prophet,)
said: Even if they are two.

 allocate at your convenience a day for us also, on which we would come to you and
 you would teach us what Allah has taught you.  He said: You assemble on such and
 such a day.  They assembled and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to
 them and taught them what Allah had taught him and he then said: No woman
 amongst you who sends her three children as her forerunners (in the Hereafter) but
 they would serve him as a protection against Hell-Fire.  A woman said: What about
 two and two and two?  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:
 Even if they are two and two and two.

Abu Hassan reported : I said to Abu Huraira that my two children had
 died.  Would you narrate to me anything from Allah's Messenger (may peace be
 upon him) a hadith which would soothe our hearts in our bereavements ? He said:
 Yes.  Small children are the fowls of Paradise.  If one of them meets his father
 (or he said his parents) he would take hold of his cloth, or he said with his hand as
 I take hold of the hem of your cloth (with my hand).  And he (the child) would not
 take off (his hand) from it until Allah causes his father to enter Paradise.  This hadith
 has been narrated on the authority of Tamim with the same chain of transmitters.
  And he is reported to have said: Did you hear from Allah's Messenger (may peace be
