Abu Salama reported : I used to see dreams (and was so much perturbed)
that I began to quiver and have temperature, but did not cover myself with a mantle.
I met Abu Qatada and made a mention of that to him. He said: I heard Allali's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) as saying: A good vision comes from Allah and a
(bad) dream (hulm) from devil.  So when one of.you sees a bad dream (hulm) which he
does not like, he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from
its evil; then it will not harm him.

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying : 
When the time draws near (when the Resurrection is near) a believer's dream
can hardly be false.  And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful
in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and
dreams are of three types: one good dream which is a sort of good tidings from
Allah ; the evil dream which causes pain is from the satan ; and the third one is a
suggestion of one's own mind; so if any one of you sees a dream which he does
not like he should stand tip and offer prayer and he should not relate it to people, and
he said: I would love to see fetters (in the dream), but I dislike wearing of necklace,
for the fetters is (an indication of) one's steadfastness in religion.  The narrator said:
I do not know whether this is a part of the hadith or the words of Ibn Sirin.

It is reported eithfr on the authority of Ibn Abbas or on the authority of

said: Allah's Messenger, I saw while I was sleeping during the night (this vision) that
there was a canopy from which butter and honey were trickling and I also saw people
collecting them in the palms of their hands, some more, some less, and I also saw a
rope connecting the earth with the sky and I saw you catching hold of it and rising
towards the heaven; then another person after you catching hold of it and rising
towards(Heaven); then another person catching hold of it, but it was broken while it
was rejoined for him and he also climbed up.  Abu Bakr said: Allah's Messenger, may
my father be sacrificed for you, by Allah, allow me to interpret it.  Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) sail: Well, give its interpretation.  Thereupon Abu Bakr said:
The canopy signifies the canopy of Islam and that what it trickles out of it in the
form of butter and honey is the Holy Qur'an and its sweetness and softness and what
the people get hold of it in their palms implies major portion of the Qur'an or the
small portion; and so far as the rope joining the sky with the earth is concerned, it is
the Truth by which you stood (in the worldly life) and by which Allah would raise
you (to Heaven).  Then the person after you would take hold of it and he would also
climb up with the help of it.  Then another person would take hold of it and climb up
with the help of it.  Then another person would take hold of it and it would be broken;
then it would be rejoined for him and he would climb up with the help of it.  Allah's
Messenger, may my father be taken as a ransom for you, tell me whether I have interpreted
it currectly or I have made an error.  Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
said: You have interpreted a part of it correctly and you have erred in interpreting a
part of it. Thereupon he said: Allah's Messenger, by Allah, tell me that part where
