<p>
'Ali b. Abu Talib reported; There fell to my lot along with Allah's   
Messenger (may peace be upon him) an old she-camel from the spoils of Badr.  Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) granted me another camel.  I made them kneel
down one day at the door of an Ansari, and I wanted to carry on them Idhkhir (a
kind of grass) in order to sell that.  There was with me a goldsmith of the tribe of
Qainuqa'. I saught to give a wedding feast (on the occasion of marriage with) Fatima
with the help of that (the price accrued from the sale of this grass).  And Hamza b.
'Abd al-Muttalib was busy in drinking in that house in the company of a singing girl
who was singing to him. She said: Hamza, get up for slaughtering the fat she-camels.
Hamza attacked them with the sword and cut off their humps and ripped their
haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to Ibn Shihab: Did he take out anything 
from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps altogether. Ibn Shihab reported
'Ali having said: I saw this (horrible) sight and it shocked me, and I came to Allah's
Apostle (may peace be upon him) and there was Zaid b, Haritha with him and communicated 
to him this news. He came in the company of Zaid and I also went along
with him and he went to Hamza and he expressed anger with him.  Hamza raised his
eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he went away
from them.

Husain b. 'Ali reported 'Ali having said: There fell to my lot a she-camel
out of the spoils of war on the Day of Badr, and Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) gave me (another) she-camel on that day out of the Khums (one-fifth reserved for
Allah and His Messenger).  When I made up my mind to consummate my marriage with
Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), I prevailed
upon a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa' to go along with me so that we might
bring Idhkhir wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able
to arrange my wedding feast.  While I was arranging the equipments. i.e. litters,
sacks and ropes, my two she-camels were sitting down at the side of the apartment of
a person of the Ansar.  I collected (the different articles of equipment) and found to my
surprise that their humps had been chopped off and their haunches had been cut off and
their livers had been taken out. I could not help weeping when I saw that plight of
theirs.  I said: Who has done that?  They said: Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib has done this.
and he is in this house dead drunk in the company of some of the Ansair with asinging girl
singing before him and his companions.  She said in her song: O Hamza. get up and attack 
these falty she-camels.  Thereupon Hamza stood up with a sword (in his hand) and
cut off their humps and ripped their haunches and tore out their livers. 'Ali said: I
went away until I came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was
with him Zaid b. Haritha.  Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) recognised from
my face what I had experienced, whereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) said: What has happened to you? I said: Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have
never seen (such an unfortunate day) as this day.  Hamza has committed aggression
to my she-camels, and has cut off their humps. and ripped their haunches, and he is
in a house in the company of some drunkards. (Hearing this) Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him) sent for his mantle and, putting it on him, he proceeded, and I
and Zaid b. Haritha followed him, until he came to the door (of the house) in which
there was Hamza.  He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they granted him. and
they were all drunk. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to reprimand 
Hamza for what he had done.  Hamza's eyes were red.  He cast a glance at Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) and then looked towards his knees. and then
lifted his eyes and cast a glance at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face.
And then Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my father? Alah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to know that he was intoxicated, and he
thus turned upon his heels, and came out, and we also came out along with him.

Anas b. Malik reported: I was the cup-bearer of some people in the house
of Abu Talha on the day when liquor was forbidden. Their liquor had been prepared
from dry dates or fresh dates  when the announcer made the announcement.  He (Abu
Talha) said to me: Go out and find out (what the announcement is).  I got out (and found)
an announcer making this announcement: Behold, liquor has been declared unlawful.
He said: The liquor (was spilt and) flawed in the lanes of Medina.  Abu Talha said
to me: Go out and Spill it, and I spilt it.  They said or some of them said : Such
and such were killed, such and such were killed for (the wine) had been in their
stomachs.  He (the narrator) said.I do not know whether it is the narration transmitted
by Anas, (or by someone else). Then Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed : "There
shall be no sin (imputed) unto those who have believed and done good works for what
they may have eaten as long as they fear (Allah) and believe and do good works"

 Messenger (may peace be upon him).  He commanded Abu Usaid to send a message to
 her and he (accordingly) sent a message to her.  She came and stayed in the fortresses
 of Banu Sa'idah. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) went out until he came
 to her while she was (at that time) sitting with her head downcast.  When Allah's
 Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked to her, she said: I seek refuge with Allah
 from you.  Thereupon he said : I (have decided to) keep you away from me. They (the
 people near her) said: Do you know who he is?  She said: No.  They said: He is the
 Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).  He came to you in order to give you the
 proposal of marriage.  She said: Then I am the most unfortunate woman because of this
 (i.e. my defiance).  Sahl said: Allah's.  Messenger (may peace be upon him) then set forth
 on that day until he sat in the Saqifa of Banu Sa'idah along with his Companions.
  He then said to Sahl : Serve us drink.  He (Sahl) said: I brought out for them this bowl
 (containing drink) and served them this.  Abu Hazim said: Sahl brought out this cup
 for us and we also drank from that.  Then 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz asked him to give
 that (cup) as a gift to him and he gave (it to) him as a gift.  In the narration of Abu
 Bakr b. Ishaq (the words) are: "Sahl, serve us drink."

amongst them would entertain us. So we came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be

awake hear it.  He would then go to the mosque and say prayer, then go to the milk and
drink it.  Miqdad added: One night the Satan came to me when I had taken my share,
and he said: Muhammad has gone to the Ansar, who would offer him hospitality and
he would get what is with them, and he has no need for this draught (of milk).  So I
took (that milk) and drank it, and when it had penetrated deeply in my stomach and

drink reserved for Muhammad!  When he would come and he would not find it, he
would curse you, and you would be ruined, and thus there would go (waste) this world

nothing but a mercy from Allah.  Why is it that you did not give me an opportunity so

away and kept myself away by that time.  He again said: O stupid fellow, I ask you
on oath that In case you hear my voice you come to me.  I came and said: By Allah,
there is no fault of mine.  These are your guests; you may ask them. I provided them
with food but they refused to eat until you came.  He said to them: Why is it that
you did not accept our food?  By Allah, I shall not even take food tonight (as you have
not taken).  They said: By Allah, we would not take until you join us.  Thereupon he
Abu Bakr) said: I have never seen a more unfortunate night than this.  Woe be to
thee! that you do not accept from us food prepared for you.  He again said: What I
did first (that is the taking of vow for not eating the food) was prompted by the
Satan. Bring the food.  The food was brought, and he ate by reciting the name of
Allah and they also ate, and when it was morning he came to Allah's Apostle (may
peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, their oath (that of the guests) came
to be true, but mine was not true, and after that he informed him of the whole
incident.  He said: Your oath came to be the most true and you are the best of
them. He (the narrator) said.  I do not know whether he made an atonement for it.
