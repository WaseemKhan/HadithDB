  summon the guards of the Hell.  Nay! Obey not thou him" (Icvi. 6-19). (Rather prostrate

  lying on the bed that a person came and said: Abd Abd al-Rabmin, a story-teller
  at the gates of Kinda says that the verse (of the Qur'an) which deals with the "smoke"
  implies that which is about to come and it would hold the breath of the infidels and
  would inflict the believers with cold.  Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O
  people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say
  which he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He
  has the best knowledge amongst all of you.  It does not behove him to say that which
  he does not know.  Allah has the best knowledge of it.  Verily Allah, the Exalted and
  Glorious, said to His Prophet (may peace be upon him) to state:"I do not ask from you
  any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble," and when Allah's
  Mesqenger (may peace be upon him) saw people turning back(from religion) he said:
  O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were
  afflicted with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were 
  obliged to eat the hides and the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them
  looked towards the sky and he found a smoke.  And Abu Sufyan came and he said:
  Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood-
  relation whereas your people are undone ; supplicate Allah for tlicm.  Thereupon Allah,
  the Exalted and Glorious, said: "Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke
  from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent" up to
  the words: "you are going to return to (evil)." (if this verse implied the torment of the
  next life) could the chastisement of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur'an states) :
  On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We shall exact
  retribution" (xliv. 16) ? The seizing (in the hadith) implies that of the Day of Badr.

  Masruq reported that there came to Abdullah a person and said: I have
  left behind in the mosque a man who explains the Qur'an according to his personal
  discretion and he explained this verse: "So wait for the day when the Heaven brings
  a clear smoke." He says that a smoke would come to the people on the Day of
  Resurrection anl it will withhold breath and they would be inflicted with cold. 'Abdullah
  said: He who has knowledge should say something and he who has no knowledge
  should simply say: Allah is best aware.  This reflects the understanding of a person
  that he should say about that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows
  best.  The fact is that when the Quraish disobeyed Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon

  was done in case of Yusuf.  And they were so much hard pressed that a person would
  ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they
  were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to
  Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger. seek forgiveness
  for the tribe of Mudar for (its people) have been undone.  The Messenger (may peace
  be upon him) said: For Mudar? You are overbold, but he supplicated Allah for them.
  It was upon this that this verse was revealed: "We shall remove the chastisement a
  little, but they will surely return to evil" (xliv. 15). lie (the narrator) said: There
  was a downpoor of rain upon them. When there was some relief for them they returned
  to the same position as they had been before, and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious,
  revealed this verse: "So wait for the day when the heaven brings a clear smoke
