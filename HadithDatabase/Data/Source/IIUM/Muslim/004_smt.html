INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
 Prayer is the soul of religion. Where there is no prayer , there can be no purification
of the soul. The non-praying man is rightly considered to be a soulless man. Take 
prayer out of the world, and it is all over with religion because it is with prayer that
man has the consciousness of God and selfless love for humanity and inner sense of
piety.Prayer is, therefore, the first, the highest, and the most solemn phenomenon and
manifestation of religion.
<p>
The way in which prayer is offered and the words which are recited in it explain
the true nature of religion of which it is the expression of man's contact with the Lord.

<p> 
Prayer in Islam gives in a nutshell the teachings of Islam. The very first thing
which comes into prominence in Islamic prayer is that it is accompanied by bodily 
movements. It implies that Islam lifts not only the soul to the spiritual height, but
also illuminates the body of man with the light of God-consciousness.It aims at purifying
both body and soul, for it finds no cleavage between them.Islam does not regard
body and soul as two different entities opposed to each other, or body as the prison of
the soul from which It yearns to secure freedom in order to soar to heavenly heights.
"The soul is an organ of the body which exploits it for physiological purposes, or body
is an instrument of the soul" (Iqbal, Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, p
105), and thus both need spiritual enlightenment.
<p>
Secondly, Islamic prayer does not aim at such a spiritual contact with God in
which the world and self are absolutely denied, in which human personality is dissolved,
disappears and is absorbed in the Infinite Lord.Islam does not favour such a meditation
and absorption in which man ceases to be conscious of his own self and feels
himself to be perfectly identified with the Infinite, and claims in a mood of ecstasy:
My "I" has become God, or rather he is God. Islam wants to inculcate the consciousness
of the indwelling of the light of God in body and soul but does allow him to
transport himself in the realm of lnfinity. It impresses upon his mind that he is the
humble servant of the Great and Glorious Lord and his spiritual development and
religious piety lies in sincere and willing obedience to Allah.The very first step towards
the achievement of this objective is that man should have a clear consciousness of his
own finiteness and Infiniteness of the Lord, and clearly visualise and feel that he is
created as a human being by the Creator and Master of the universe, and he cannot,
therefore, become demi-god or god.His success lies in proving himself by his outlook
and behaviour that he is the true and loyal servant of his Great Master.Islamic prayer
is, therefore, the symbol of humble reverence before the Majesty of the Glorious Lord.

be appointed who should call (people) to prayer?The Messenger of Allah (may peace

 worship and of Thee do we ask help, He (Allah) says: This is between Me and My
 servant, and My servant will receive what he asks for.Then, when he (the worshipper)
 says: Guide us to the straight path, the path of those to whom Thou hast been
 Gracious not of those who have incurred Thy displeasure, nor of those who have
 gone astray, He (Allah) says: This is for My servant, and My servant will receive

 Abu Juhaifa  reported it on the authority of his father: I came to the
Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) in Mecca and he was (at that time) at al-
Abtah in a red leather tent. And Bilal stepped out with ablution water for him. (And
what was left out of that water) some of them got it (whereas others could not get it)
and (those who got it) rubbed themselves with it.  Then the Apostle of Allah (may peace
be upon him) stepped out with a red mantle on him and I was catching a glimpse of
the whiteness of his shanks.  The narrator said: He (the Holy Prophet) performed the
ablution. and Bilal pronounced Adhan and I followed his mouth (as he turned) this side
and that as he said on the right and the left: "Come to prayer, come to success."' A
spear was then fixed for him (on the ground).  He stepped forward and said two rak'ahs
of Zuhr, while there passed in front of him a donkey and a dog, and these were not
checked.  He then said two rak'ahs of the 'Asr prayer, and he then continued saying
two rak'ahs till he came back to Medina.

the ruins should be levelled.  The trees (were thus) placed in rows towards the qibla and
the stones were set on both sides of the door, and (while building the mosque) they
(the Companions) sang rajaz verses along with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

<p><blockquote>

 	So help the Ansar and the Muhajirin.
