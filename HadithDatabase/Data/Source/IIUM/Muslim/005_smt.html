INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
Of the five fundamentals of Islam, Zakat occupies the second
positioin, the first being prayer (salat). This word is derived
from Zakd, which means it (a plant) grew. The second
derivative of this word carries the sense of purificatin, e.g.
Qad aflaha man zakkaha (he is indeed successful who purified
himself). The other word used for zakat both in the Qur'an and
the Hadith is sadaqa which is derived from sidq (the truth). Both
these words are highly meaningful. The spending of wealth for the
sake of Allah purifies the heart of man of the love of material
wealth. The man who spends it offers that as a humble gift before
the Lord and thus affirms the truth that nothing is dearer to him
in life than the love of Allah and that he is full prepared to
sacrifice everything for His sake. Secondly, zakat is the most
effective measure to improve the economic condition of the
have-nots. It is not, however, a mere tax, but a form of worship
whereby a man comes close to his Lord. The Muslims have,
therefore, been enjoined to pay zakat with the same sense of
earnestness and devotion in which the seeker of the Lord observes
the prayer. The primary motive of zakat is religious and
spiritual, while the social and economic aspects are subservient
to it. Its social significance is that it awakens in man the
sense of brotherhood with less fortunate members of society, and
stirs his moral conscience to make sacrifice for their sake. From
the economic point of view it discourages hoarding and
concentration of wealth and helps its steady and constant flow
from the rich to the poor. It is in fact a good means of
providing purchasing power to the poor, for ameliorating their
hard lot and enabling them to stand on their own legs. 
<p>
It should also be remembered that zakat or sadaqa in Islam is
not a voluntary act of charity which a rich man gives to the poor
out of his own sweet will, but it is an obligatory act which
every Muslim is enjoined upon to perform if he is sincere in his
belief in God and the Hereafter. Thus there is no burden of
obligation on one who receives zakat, but a sense of thankfulness
and gratitude on the part of the giver, since he has been enabled
by the recipient to discharge his obligation that he owes to God
and society. 

<blockquote><p>
    (O Prophet), take sadaqa (zakat) out of their
    property-thou wouldst cleanse them and purify them thereby
    (Qur'an, ix. 103). And away from it (the Hell) shall be kept
    the most faithful to duty who gives his wealth, purifying
    himself (xcii. 17-18). 
</blockquote>
<p>
So much is the importance of zakat in Islam that it has been
mentioned at eightytwo places in the Qur'an in close connection
with prayer. The Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be
upon him) knew its basic importance in Islam. It is a known fact
that after the death of the Apostle of Allah (may peace he upon
him) when some of the tribes, who believed in the oneness of God
and observed prayer, refused to pay zakat, the first Caliph Abu
Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him), in an answer to the
advice of Hadrat 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him) to show
tolerance towards such people. said in explicit terms, By
Allah, I would definitely wage war against them
who dissociate prayer from Zakat. Zakat is paid on the
surplus of wealth which is left over after the passage of a year.
It is thus a payment on the accumulated wealth. Leaving aside
animals and agricultural yield, zakat is paid at almost a uniform
rate of two and a half %. The minimum standard of surplus wealth
over which zakat is charged is known as Nisab. It differs with
different kinds of property, the most important being 200 dirhams
or 521 tolas (nearly 21 oz.) In case of silver, and 20 mithqals
or 71 tolas (nearly 3 oz.) in case of gold. The nisab of cash is
the same as that of gold and silver. 
<p>
As regards the persons to whom zakat is to be paid, they have
been clearly described in the Holy Qur'an: Alms are only
for the poor, the needy, the officials charged with the duty of
collection, those whose hearts are inclined to truth, the
ransoming of captives, those in debt, in the way of Allah, and
the wayfarer (ix 60).

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying:
If any owner of gold or silver does not pay what is due on him, when the Day of
Resurrection would come, plates of fire would be beaten out for him; these would then
be heated in the fire of Hell and his sides, his forehead and his back would be cauterized
with them. Whenever these cool down, (the process is) repeated during a day the
extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among
servants, and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell.  It was
said: Messenger of Allah, what about the camel?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: If any
owner of the camel does not pay what is due on him, and of his due in that (camel) is
(also) to milk it on the day when it comes down to water. When the Day of Resurrection
 comes a soft sandy plain would be set for him, as extensive as possible, (he
will find) that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample him with
their hoofs and bite him with their mouths.  As often as the first of them passes him,
the last of them would be made to return during a day the extent of which would be
fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants and he sees whether
his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell.  It was (again) said: Messenger of Allah,
what about cows (cattle) and sheep?  He said: It any owner of the cattle and sheep
does not pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy
plain would be spread for them, he will find none of them missing, with twisted horns,
without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and
trample him with their hoofs.  As often as the first of them passes him the last of them
would be made to return to him during a day the extent of which would be fifty
thousand years, until judgment would be pronounced among the servants.  And he
would be shown his path-path leading him to Paradise or to Hell.  It was said:
Messenger of Allah, what about the horse?  Upon this he said: The horses are of three
types.  To one than (these are) a burden, and to another man (these are) a covering, and
still to another man (these are) a source of reward.  The one for whom these are a
burden is the person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for opposing
the Muslims; so they are a burden for him.  The one for whom these are a covering is
the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the right of Allah
concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a covering for him.  As for
those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who rears them for the sake of
Allah to be used for Muslims and he puts them in meadow and field.  And whatever
thing do these eat from that meadow and field would be recorded on his behalf as good
deeds, as would also the amount of their dung and urine. And these would not break
their halter and prance a course or two without having got recorded the amount of their
hoof marks and their dung as a good deed on his behalf (on behalf of their owner). And
their master does not bring them past a river from which they drink, though he did not
intend to quench their thirst, but Allah would record for him the amount of what they
drink on his behalf as deeds. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the
asses?, Upon this he said: Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the asses
(in particular) except this one verse of a comprehensive nature: "He who does an
atom's weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom's weight of evil will see
it" (xcix. 7)

goodness is ingrained in the foreheads of the horses (Suhail said: I am in doubt as to what
was actually said) up till the Day of judgement.  The horses are of three kinds. They are
a source of reward to a person, they are a covering to a person, and they are a burden to
a person.  As for those which bring reward is that a person would get reward who rears
them for the sake of Allah and trains them for Him, and nothing disappears in their
stomachs but Allah would record for him a good deed.  And if they were to graze in
the meadow, they would eat nothing but Allah would record for him a reward.  And if
they were to drink water from the canal, with every drop that, would disappear in
their stomachs there would be reward (for the owner). He went on describing till a
reward was mentioned for their urine and dung.  And if they pranced a course or two,
there would be recorded a reward for every pace that they covered.  As for one for
whom they are a covering, he is the man who rears them for honour and dignity but
does not forget the right of their backs and their stomachs, in plenty and adversity,
As regards one for whom they are  a burden, he is that who rears them for vainglory
and showing off to the people; for him they are, the burden.  They said: Messenger of
Allah, what about asses?  He said: Allah has not revealed to me anything in regards to
it except this one comprehensive verse : "He who does an atom's weight of good will

camel) would come and the owner would be made to sit on a soft sandy ground and
they would trample him with their feet and hooves.  And no owner of the cattle who

more (among this flock of sheep and goat) without horns or with broken horns.  And
no owner of the treasure who does not pay its due but his treasure would come on
the Day of Resurrection like a bald snake and would pursue him with its mouth open,
and when it would come near he would run away from it, and he would be called
thus: "Take your treasure which you concealed, for I do not need it." When he would
find no way out he would put his hand in its mouth and it would gnaw it
like a he-camel.  Abu Zubair said: We heard Ubaid b. Umair saying this.  We
then asked Jabir b. 'Abdullah about this.  And he also said like Ubaid b. Umair,
Abu Zubair said: I heard 'Ubaid b. 'Umair saying: A man said: Messenger of Allah,
what is due on camels?  He said: Milking them near water, and lending of bucket (used
for drawing water from it), or lending its male for mating with a she-camel and providing
it as a ride for the sake of Allah.

(would be spared punishment) but would be made to sit on the Day of Resurrection on
a soft sandy ground and the hoofed animals would trample him with their hoofs and gore
him with their horns.  And none of them on that day would be without horns, or with
broken horns.  We said: Messenger of.Allab, but what is due on them?  He said: Lending
of the male (for use) and lending of the bucket (used for drawing water for them) and
for mating and milking them near water and providing them as a ride for the sake of Allah.
And no owner of the property who does not pay Zakat (would be spared punishment)
but it (his property) would turn into a bald snake and would follow its owner wherever
he would go, and he would run away from it, and it would be said to him: That is your
property about which you were stingy.  And when he would find no other way out he
would thrust his hand in its mouth and it would gnaw it like a male camel.

means) to do so?  He said: Let him work with both his hands, thus doing benefit to
himself and give Sadaqa.  It was said to him: What about him who does not have (the
means) to do so? He said: Then let him assist the needy, the aggrieved.  It was said:
What do you say of one who cannot even do this?  He said: Then he should enjoin
what is reputable or what is good.  He said: What about him if he cannot do that?  He
(the Holy Prophet) said: He should then abstain from evil, for verify that is Sadaqa on
his behalf.

Sura Hashr: "Fear Allah. and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the
morrow and fear Allah" (lix. 18). (Then the audience began to vie with one another
in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some
donated a sa' of wheat, some a sa' of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring)
even if it is half a date.  Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money
bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift).  Then the people

Messenger of Allah, I said: Does good produce evil?  The Messenger of Allah (may

plants the spring rain produces There some which kill with a tremour or nearly kill all
but the animal which feeds on vegetation.  It eats and when its flanks are distended,
it faces the can. then when it has donged or urinated and chewed it returns and eats.
He who accepts wealth rightly, Allah confers blessing on it for him. and he who takes
wealth without any right, he is like one who eats and is not satisfied.

the adornments of the world and its beauties.  A person said: Messenger of Allah, does

What Is the matter with you, that you speak with the Messenger of Allah (may peace

kills or is about to kill, but that (animal) which feeds on vegetation.  It eats till its

it would not go beyond their throat; they would kill the followers of Islam and
would spare the idol-worshippers.  They would glance through the teachings of Islam so
hurriedly just as the arrow passes through the pray.  If I were to ever find them I
would kill them like 'Ad.

Abu Said al-Khudri reported: 'Ali b. Abu Talib sent to the Messenger of
Allah (may peace be upon him) from Yemen some gold alloyed with clay in a leather
bag dyed in the leaves of Mimosa flava.He distributed it among four men.  'Uyaina b.
Hisna, Aqra' b. Habis and Zaid al-Khail, and the fourth one was either Alqama b.
'Ulatha or 'Amir b. Tufail.  A person from among his(Prophet's) Companions said: We
had a better claim to this (wealth) than these (persons).  This (remark) reached the
Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) upon which he said: Will you not trust me,
whereas I am a trustee of Him Who is in the heaven?  The news come to me from the
heaven morning and evening. Then there stood up a person with deep snnken eyes,
prominent cheek bones, and elevated forehead, thick beard, shaven head, tucked up
loin cloth, and he said: Messenger of Allah, fear Allah.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Woe
to thee. do I not deserve most to fear Allah amongst the people of the earth?  That
man then returned.  Khalid b. Walid then said: Messenger of Allah, should I not strike
his neck?  Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: Perhaps he may be observing the
prayer. Khalid said: How many observers of prayer are there who profess with
their tongue what is not in their heart?  Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be
upon him) said: I have not been commanded to pierce through the hearts of people, nor
to split their bellies (insides). He again looked at him and he was going back.  Upon
this he (the Holy Prophet) said: There would arise a people from the progeny of this
(man) who would recite the Qur'an glibly, but it would not go beyond their throats;
they would (hurriedly) pass through (the teachings of their) religion just as the arrow
passes through the prey.  I conceive that he (the Holy Prophet) also said this: If I find
them I would certainly kill them as were killed the (people of) Thamud.

Zaid b. Wahb Jahani reported and he was among the squadron which wall
under the command of Ali (Allah be pleased with him) and which set out (to curb the
activities) of the Khwarij.  'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: 0 people, I heard the
Messeinger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: There would arise from my Ummah
a people who would recite the Qur'an, and your recital would seem insignificant
as compared with their recital, your prayer as compared with their prayer, arid your
fast,as compared with their fast.  They would recite the Qur'an thinking that it sup-
ports them, whereas it is an evidence against them.  Their prayer does not get beyond
their collar bone; they would swerve through Islam just as the arrow passes through
the prey.  If the squadron which is to encounter them were to know (what great boon)
has been assured to them by their Apostle (may peace be upon him) they would completely rely upon this deed (alone and cease to do other good deeds), and their (that of the
Khwarij) distinctive mark is that there would be (among them) a person whose wrist
would be without the arm, and the end of his wrist would be fleshy like the nipple of
the breast on which there would be white hair.  You would be marching towards
Muawiya and the people of Syria and you would leave them behind among your
children and your property (to do harm). By Allah, I believe that these are the people
(against whom you have been commanded to fight and get reward) for they have shed
forbidden blood, and raided the animals of the people.  So go forth in the name of
Allah (to fight against them).  Salama b. Kuhail mentioned that Zaid b. Wahb made me
alight at every stage, till we crossed a bridge.  'Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi was at the
head of the Khwarij when we encountered them.  He ('Abdullah) said to his army: Throw
the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would
attack you as they attacked you on the day of Harura.  They went back and threw
their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought against them with spears
and they were killed one after another.  Only two persons were killed among the people
(among the army led by Hadrat 'Ali) on that day. 'Ali (Allah be pleased with him)
said: Find out from among them (the dead bodies of the Khwarij) (the maimed).  They
searched but did not find him.  'Ali (Allah be pleased with him) then himself stood up
and (walked) till he came to the people who had   been killed one after another. He
('Ali) said: Search them to the last, and then ('Ali's companions) found him (the dead
body of the maimed) near the earth.  He (Hadrat 'Ali) then pronounced Allah-O-Akbar
(Allah is the Greatest) and then said,  Allah told the Truth and His Messenger (may
peace be upon him) conveyed it. Then there stood before him 'Abida Salmani who
said: Commander of the Believers, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He,
(tell me) whether you heard this hadith from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be

collectors) of these sadaqat; and they would (collect them) and pay (to the Holy Prophet)
as other people (collectors) paid and would get a share as other people got it.  As they

age.  We have come (to you) so that you may appoint us (as collectors) of these sadaqat.

not to talk (any more).  He (the Holy Prophet) said; It does not become the family of

Umm 'Atiyya, said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent
me some mutton of sadaqa.  I sent a piece out of that to 'A'isha.  When the Messenger
of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to 'A'isha, he said: Have you anything with
you (to eat)?  She said: Nothing, except only that mutton sent to us by Nusaiba (the

its proper place.
