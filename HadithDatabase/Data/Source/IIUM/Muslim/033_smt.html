INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
<p>Whether the fate of man is predestined or he himself is the
architect of it, is a question which has been very often discussed by scholars of all
times. This problem is significantly important as no sensible man. not even the man in
the street, can afford to ignore it. Faith in Taqdir (Destiny) has a very deep impact
upon our lives and we always find our lives oscillating between determinism and
freewill. As a man looks around himself and looks to his own self and within himself, he
finds that there are hundred and one things in shaping and reshaping of which he has
no hand, e.g. in determining the climate of the land in which he is born, in
canalising the courses of rivers which flow therein and in determining the nature of the
soil thereof. He finds himself absolutely powerless. As he looks to himself he
finds that there are so many things In him which are beyond his control, viz. the measure
of intellect he has been endowed with, the shape and form of his physical structure
with which he has been sent to this world, and the inclinations and so many other
qualities of head and heart which are embedded in his very nature. In all these aspects
of life he finds himself helpless before the Great and Mighty Power that created him.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, there are so many things in which man finds
himself quite empowered. As he looks to the marvellous achievements of man
despite all odds, he finds it difficult to believe that he is a mere puppet in the
mighty hand of Nature. This problem of predestination and freewill, in which man finds
his life hanging, has been adequately solved by the Qur'an and the Sunnah. We give
below a brief summary of their elucidations.</p>
<p>
The first principle which Islam lays down in regard to Taqdir is
that man is neither completely the master of his fate nor is he bound to the
blind law of predestination. So far as the sovereignty of Allah's Will is
concerned, it is all-pervading and nothing falls outside its orbit. Not even a leaf, therefore,
stirs without His Will.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

It is His Will that prevails everywhere.
To God belongs the sovereignty of Heavens and the Earth. He
created what He pleaseth, giving to whom He pleaseth females and to whom He
pleaseth males or conjoining them males and females, and He maketh whom
He pleaseth barren, verify He hath knowledge and power
(xlii. 48).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Men are, therefore, completely subordinate to the overruling
power of God, they cannot do anything unless God wills so.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Whom God guideth he is the rightly-guided. Whom he sendeth
stray, thou wilt not find a patron to set him right (xviii. 16).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
His mighty grasp is, therefore, over everything. The Almighty
Lord,Who has created everything and has determined its nature and course, has in His
infinite wisdom and mercy conferred upon man a limited autonomy according to which a
man is free to do or not to do a certain thing. It is because of this autonomy
enjoyed by man that he is hold accountable for his deeds. The concept of human
responsibility and that of his answerability for his deeds and misdeeds becomes 
meaningless if he is supposed to be deprived of this autonomy. There are, a large 
number of verses in the Holy Qur'an which make a pointed reference to the autonomy 
conferred upon man.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Man shall have nothing but that what he strives for
(liii. 39).<br>
Allah does not change the condition of a people until they
change it themselves (viii. 53; xiii. 11).<br>
Those who strive in His path, are guided in the right path,
while those who persist in denial and sinful livifig have their hearts sealed
against faith (ii. 7, 26; iv. 155; v;.i. 102).<br>
Allah does not compel belief and leaves the people free to
believe or disbelieve (vi. 35, 150; xvi-. 9).<br>
Whoever has done an atorn's weight of good shall meet with
its reward and whoever has done an atom's weight of evil shall meet with its
consequences (xcix. 7-8).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should be borne in mind in this connection that the word
Taqdir used in the Qur'an does not always signify something predestined. It at times
implies a measure or the latent potentialities or possibilities with which Allali created
man and all things of Nature. For example: He created everything for its Destiny
(or its Measure) (xxv.2). In Sura 54, verse 9 (the words are): We created
everything according to a Measure or Destiny. In both these verses Destiny impiies the inward
reach of things, their latent potentialities or possibilities.</p>
<p>
The idea of Destiny as we find in the hadith that God wrote
down the decrees regarding the created world fifty thousand years before He
created the Heavens and the Earth does not in any way mean that God created a block
Universe, finished off and complete, bound to the iron formulae of Nature. Here the idea
behind Taqdir is that the creation of this universe is not accidental but
something preplanned and pre-conceived and it was shaped according to the Grand Design 
of the Greatest Designer.There is no element of chance in the creation of this Universe.
Everything is well-set and well-planned.</p>
<p>
The idea that Allah has a foreknowledge of everything that He
created and the events unfold themselves exactly according to it, does not imply
that human beings have been completely deprived of the freedom of action. The
foreknowledge of God is an acknowledged fact, but it should not be interpreter in the
sense of predestination, for if we do so we shall have to conceive of eternity as a
storehouse of ready-made events, from which they drop one by one like particles of sand in
a glass hour. If we take the foreknowledge to be a reflecting mirror we shall have to
deprive the Creator and the Controller of the Universe of His Creative activity.</p>
<p>
Dr Muhammad Iqbal has shed a good deal of light over this problem. He says:
"Divine knowledge must be conceived as a living creative activity to which the objects
that appear to exist in their own right are organically related. By conceiving God's
knowledge as a kind of reflecting mirror, we no doubt save His fore-knowledge of
future events, but it is obvious that we do so at the expense of His freedom. The
future certainly pre-exists in the organic whole of God's creative life, but it pre-exists
as an open possibility, not as a fixed order of events with definite outlines."</p>
<p>
We should bear in mind that the idea of put, present and future is something relative 
and is conceived by the inite wind of man. It is. however, a great now in the
eye of the All-Seeing God. The whole expanse of eternity lies before Him in the shape
of now. Knowledge is, therefore, an act of creative activity and not the mere reflection 
of it. When He decrees a thing it happens and He knows it before it happens. God
in Islam is not, therefore, a prisoner of necenity. He is a free Creator.</p>
<p>
The concept of predestination in Islam, therefore, does not in any way mean helpless
abandonment of oneself to otherwise unwelcome fate. It means rather co-operation 
with God, studying His will andbringingoneself into unison with His Planning Will.
Destiny as conceived by Islam is, thus, by no stretch of imagination, fatal to
the freedom of conduct and unfoldment of one's inherent possibilities; it is a source
of inspiration and encouragement and opens up vast fields of human activity. It is not
a message of despondency and despair, but a source of solace, comfort and inspiration
and a powerful means of evoking a sense of piety and humility and self-surrender to
the Will of God. It does not inculcate in mind frustration and pessimism, making his
life dark and dreary, devoid of hope and promise for the future, but it teaches him to
put his heart and soul in the sublime work as assigned to him by his Master.

Abdullah (b.  Mas'ud) reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
him) who is the most truthful (of the human beings) and his being truthful (is a fact)
said: Verily your creation is on this wise.  The constituents of one of you are collected
for forty days in his mother's womb in the form of blood, after which it becomes a
clot of blood in another period of forty days.  Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty
days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the
angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune.  By
Him, besides Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people
deserving Paradise until between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of
a cubit, when suddenly the writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like
the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the
denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that
the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of
Paradise and enters Paradise.

a person be an evil one without (cornmittilng an evil) deed?  Thereupon the person said
to him: You are surprised at this, whereas I have heard Allah's Messenger (may peace

Allah sends the angel and gives him the shape.  Then he creates his sense of hearing,
sense of sight, his skin, his flesh, his bones, and then says: My Lord, would he be male
or female ? And your Lord decides as He desires and the angel then puts down that
also and then says: My Lord, what about his age?  And your Lord decides as He likes
it and the angel puts it down.  Then he says: My Lord, what about his livelihood?
And then the Lord decides as He likes and the angel writes it down, and then the
angel gets out with his scroll of destiny in his hand and nothing is added to it and
nothing is subtracted from it.

preordained for them.  He (further) said: Then, would it not be an injustice (to punish
them) ? I felt greatly disturbed because of that, and said: Everything is created by
Allah and lies in His Power.  He would not be questioned as to what He does, but
they would be questioned; thereupon he said to me: May Allah have mercy upon

tribe of Muzaina came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said:
Allah's Messenger, what is your opinion that the people do in the world and strive

Exalted and Glorious: "Consider the soul and Him Who made it perfect, then
breathed into it its sin and its piety" (xci. 8).
