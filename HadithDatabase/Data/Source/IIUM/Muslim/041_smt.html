 (in order to kill him) and when it would enter a plain ground, it would be made to
 sink.  I said: Allah's Messenger, what about him who would be made to accompany

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:
 The Last Hour would not come until the Romans would land at al-A'maq or in Dabiq.
 An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of the earth at that time will
 come from Medina (to counteract them).  When they will arrange themselves in
 ranks, the Romans would say: Do not stand between us and those (Muslims) who took
 prisoners from amongst us.  Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay,
 by Allah, we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may
 fight them.  They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom
 Allah will never forgive.  A third (part of the army). which would be constituted of
 excellent martyrs in Allah's eye, would be killed ani the third who would never be
 put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople.  And as they
 would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging
 their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place
 among your family.  They would then come out, but it would be of no avail.  And
 when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing 
themselves for battle drawing up the ranks.  Certainly, the time of prayer shall
 come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would descend and would lead
 them in prayer.  When the enemy of Allah would see him, it would (disappear) just as
 the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all,
 even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by his hand and
 he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).

came a person who had nothing to say but (these words): Abdullah b. Mas'ud, the
Last Hour has come.  He ('Abdullah b. Mas'ud) was sitting reclining against something,
and he said: The Last Hour would not come until the people divide in-
heritance and rejoice over booty, and then said pointing towards Syria,
with the gesture of his hand like this: The enemy shall muster strength against
Muslims and the Muslims will muster strength against them (Syrians).  I said: You
mean Rome?  And he said: Yes, and there would be a terrible fight and the Muslims
would prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which would not return but
victorious.  They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return
without being victorious and both will be wiped out.  The Muslims will again prepare
a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious.  When
it would be the fourth day, a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would
be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy should be routed.  And they would
fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, so much so that even if a bird
were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them.
(There would be such a largescale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only)
one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive.  So what can
be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance would be divided ! They
  would be in this very state that they would hear of a calamity more horrible than
  this.  And a cry would reach them: The Dajjil has taken your place among your off-
  spring.  They will, therefore, throw away what would be in their hands and go forward
  sending ten horsemen,as a scouting party.  Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)

An-Nawwas b. Sam'an reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
  him) made a mention of the Dajjal one day in the morning.  He sometimes described him
  to be insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant rand we
  felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees.  When we went to him (to the
  Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he said:
  What is the matter with you?  We said : Allah's Messenger, you made a mention of the
  Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes
  very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of
  the cluster of the datpalm trees.  Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you  
  in so many other things besides the Dajjal.  If he comes forth while I am among on, I shall
  contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you,
  a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my
  behalf (and safeguard him against his evil).  He (Dajjal) would be a young man with
  twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye.  I compare him to 'Abd-ul-'Uzza b.
  Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the
  opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii.). He would appear on the way between Syria and
  Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah ! adhere (to the path
  of Truth).  We said: Allah's Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth?  He said..
  For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week
  and the rest of the days would be like your days.  We said: Allah's Messenger, would
  one day's prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year?  Thereupon he said:
  No, but you must make an estimate of time  (and then observe prayer).  We said:
  Allah's Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth?  Thereupon he said:
  Like cloud driven by the wind.  He would come to the people and invite them (to a
  wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him.  He
  would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and
  it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their posturing animals would come to them
  with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched.
  He would then come to another people and invite them.  But they would reject him
  and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing
  would be lef t with them in the form of wealth.  He would then walk through the waste,
  land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and
  collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees.  He would then call a person
  brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and
  (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his
  target.  He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with
  his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would at this very time that Allah would
  send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern 
  side of Damscus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands
  on the wings of two Angels.  When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of
  perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would
  scatter from it.  Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die
  and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see.  He would then search
  for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill
  him.  Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and
  he would wipe their faces  and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and
  it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I
  have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would
  be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog
  and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope.  The first of them would
  pass the lake of Tibering and drink out of it.  And when the last of them would
  pass, he would say: There was once water there.  Jesus and his companions would then
  be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the
  ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinirs and Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and
  his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would
  attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person.
  Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and
  they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled
  with their putrefaction and stench.  Allah's Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would
  then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of
  bactrin camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will.  Then
  Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels' hairs would
  keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror.  Then
  the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result
  thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able
  to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that
  a whole party would be able to drink it.  And the milch camel would give such (a large
  quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch
  sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of
  that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people)
  even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked 
would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would
  come to them.

 would say to him: Where do you intend to go?  He would say: I intend to go to this

 would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him.
 Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to
 kill anyone without (his consent)?  And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when
 the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah's
 Messenger (may peace be upon him) has informed (us).  The Dajjal would then order for
 breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head.  He
 would be struck even on his back and on his stomach.  Then the Dajjal would ask him:
 Don't you believe in me?  He would say: You are a false Masih.  He would then order him
 to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs.  After
 that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces.  He would then say to him: Stand,
 and he would stand erect.  He would then say to him: Don't you believe in me?  And
 the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are
 really the Dajjal).  He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone
 amongst people (in such a manner) after me.  The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him
 so that he should kill him (again).  The space between his neck and collar bone would
 be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him.  So he would catch hold
 of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think

  daughter of Qais and sister of ad-Dahhak b. Qais and she was the first amongst the
emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there is no extra link in between them.
She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do
It and narrate that to me.  She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen
young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting)
on the side of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him).  When I became a widow,
'Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him), sent me the proposal of marriage.  Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid.
And it had been conveyed to me that Allah's Messenger (way peace be upon him) had
said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usima.  When Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in
your hand.  You may marry me to anyone whom you like.  He said: You better shift
now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the
Anqir.  She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very
hospitably.  I said: Well, I will do as you like.  He said: Do not do that for Umm
Sharik is a woman who is very frequently vizited by guests and I do not like that your
head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers
may catch sight of them which you abhor.  You better shift to the house of your cousin
'Abdullah b. 'Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani  Fihr branch of the
Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which F5tiina) belonged.  So I shifted to
that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer
making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where)
congregational prayer (is observed).  So I set out towards that mosque and observed
prayer along with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I was in the row of
the women which was near the row of men.  When Allah's Messenger (may peace be

worshipper should keep sitting at his place.  He then said: Do you know why I had
asked you to assemble?  They said: Allah and His Messenger know best.  He said: By
Allah.  I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have
detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me
something, which agrees with what I was-telling, yuu about the Dajjal.  He narrated to
me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani  Lakhm and Bani
Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month.  Then these (waves)
took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset.  They sat in
a small side-boat and entered that Island.  There was a beast with long thick hair (and
because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back.  They said: Woe to
you, who can you be?  Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is
al-Jassasa?  And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very
much eager to know about you.  He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us
we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil.  Then we hurriedly went on till we came
to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck
and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles.  We said: Woe be upon
thee, who are you?  And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me
  who are you.  We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat
  but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this
  island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with
  profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be
  distinguished from his back.  We said: Woe be to thee, who are you?  It said: I am al-
  Jassasa.  We said: What is al-Jassasa?  And it said: You go to this very person in the

  information ? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.  We said: Yes
  Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits.  He said: Inform me about the lake

  water in it and does it irrigate (the land) ? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water
  in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform
  me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done?  We said: He has come out from
  Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina).  He said: Do the Arabs fight against him?
  We said: Yes.  He said: How did he deal with him?  We informed him that he had
  overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him.
  Thereupon he said to us: Had it actually happened?  We said: Yes.  Thereupon he
  said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am

  (may peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said :
  This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal)
  like this?'The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by
  me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal)
  at Medina and Mecca.  Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranian) or the
  Yemen sea (Arabian sea).  Nay, on the contrary, he As In the east, he is in the east, he is
