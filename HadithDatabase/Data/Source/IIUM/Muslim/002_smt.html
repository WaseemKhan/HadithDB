INTRODUCTION
</font></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
     We have read in the first Book that the love of Allah is the highest aim of a
true believer.  It is for the achievement of this single end that he affirms his faith in
Him by renouncing all other types of godhood.
<p>
     The love of God is not something inert or lifeless; it is dynamic in the sense that
it calls for a complete change in the life of man: change in his thoughts and ideas and
change in his conduct and behaviour.  One who claims to be a believer in Allah has to
make a good deal of effort with a view to pleasing his :lord.  He has to purify his soul
from all evil thoughts and fancies so that the love of God should reside in it.  Unless
the soul is purged of all impurities one cannot achieve salvation.  This is known as
Tahdrah in Islam, and it is the foundation-stone of Imin.  This high objective of the
purification of the soul requires intentional and deliberate efforts and a good deal of
sacrifice on the part of man, and the most elementary stage in this sacred path is
the cleanliness of body.
<p>
     By enjoining cleanliness of body upon man Islam awakens him to the realisation of
the fact that when impurities on the body of a man produce such unhealtby effects on
his physical being and corrode his mental health, how miserable his life would be when
his soul is polluted with impurities.  The process of the purification of the soul should,
therefore, start with the purification of the body.

  Abu Malik at-Ash'ari reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon
him) said : Cleanliness is half of faith and al-Hamdu Liliah (Praise be to Allah) fills the
scale, and Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah) and al-Hamdu Liliah (Praise be to Allah)
fill upwhat is between the heavens and the earth, and prayer is a light, and charity
is proof (of one's faith) and endurance is a brightness and the Holy Qur'an is a proof
on your behalf or against you. All men go out early in the morning and sell themselves,
thereby setting themselves free or destroying themselves.

Abu Huraira reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:
When a bondsman-a Muslim or a believer-washes his face (in course of ablution),
every sin he contemplated with his eyes,will be washed away from his face along with
water, or with the last drop of water; when he washes his hands, every sin they wrought
will be effaced from his hands with the water, or with the last drop of water; and when
he washes his feet, every sin towards which his feet have walked will be washed away
with the water or with the last drop of water with the result that he comes out pure
from all sins.
