      said this: Two are the types of the denizens of Hell whom I did not see : people having
      flogs like the tails of the ox with them and they would be beating people, and the
      women who would be dressed but appear to be naked, who would be inclined (to evil)
      and make their husbands incline towards it.  Their heads would be like the humps of
      the bukht camel inclined to one side.  They will not enter Paradise and they would not
      smell its odour whereas its odour would be smelt from such and such distance.

 A'isha reported that a woman said: Allah's Messenger, may I say to my
      (co-wife) that my husband has given me (such and such) a thing but which he has not
      in fact gives me? 'Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The
      one who makes a false statement of that which one has not been given is like one who
      wears a garment of falsehood.

 Asma' reported that a woman came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon
      him) and said: I have a co-wife.  Is there any harm for me if I give her the false 
      impression (of getting something from my husband which he has not in fact given me)?
      Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The one who creates
      such a (false impression) of receiving what one has not been given is like one who
      wears the garment of falsehood.
