they did not dine with her, nor did they live with them in their houses; so the
Companions of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) asked The Apostle (may peace be
upon him), and Allah, the Exalted revealed: "And they ask you about menstruation;
say it is a pollution, so keep away from woman during menstruation" to the end
(Qur'an, ii. 222).  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do 
everything  except intercourse.  The Jews heard of that and said: This man does not want to 
leave anything we do without opposing us in it.  Usaid b. Hudair and Abbad
b. Bishr came and said: Messenger of Allah, the Jews say such and such thing.  We
should not have, therefore, any contactwith them (as the Jews do).  The face of the
Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) underwent such a change that we thought
he was angry with them, but when they went out, they happened to receive a gift of
milk which was sent to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him).  He (the Holy

Amongst the traditions narrated from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah
(may peace be upon him) on the authority of Abu Huraira, the one is that Banu
Isra'il used to take a bath naked, and they looked at the private parts of one
another. Moses (peace be upon him), however, took a bath alone (in privacy);
and they said (tauntingly): By Allah, nothing prohibits Moses to take a bath along
with us, but sacrotal hernia. He (Moses) once went for a bath and placed his
clothes on a stone and the stone moved on with his clothes. Moses ran after it
saying: 0 stone, my clothes, 0 stone, my clothes, and Banu Isra'il had the chance to
see the private parts of Moses, and said : By Allah, Moses does not suffer from any
ailment.  The stone then stopped, till Moses had been seen by them, and he then took
hold of his clothes and struck the stone.  Abu Huraira said: By Allah, there are the
marks of six or seven strokes made by Moses on the stone.

'A'isha reported she had borrowed from Asma' (her sister) a necklace and
it was lost.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent men to search for
it. As it was the time for prayer, they offered prayer without ablution (as water was
not available there).  When they came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon
him), they made a complaint about it, and the verses pertaining to tayammum were
revealed.  Upon this Usaid b. Hadair said (to 'A'isha): May Allah grant you a good
reward!  Never has been there an occasion when you were beset with difficulty and
Allah did not make you come out of that and made it an occasion of blessing for the
Muslims.

Shaqiq reported : I was sitting in the company of Abdullah and Abu Musa
when Abu Musa said: 0 'Abd al-Rahman (kunya of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud), what
would you like a man to do about the prayer if he experiences a seminal emission or has
sexual intercourse but does not find water for a month ?'Abdullah said: He should not
perform tayammum even if he does not find water for a month. 'Abdullah said:
Then what about the verse in Sura Ma'ida: "If you do not find water, betake yourself 
to clean dust" ? 'Abdullah said : If they were granted concession on the basis of
this verse, there is a possibility that they would perform tayammum with dust on finding 
water very cold for themselves.  Abu Musa said to Abdullah: You have not heard
the words of 'Ammar: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent me on
an errand and I had a seminal emission, but could find no water, and rolled myself in
dust just as a beast rolls itself. I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon
him) then and made a mention of that to him and he (the Holy Prophet)said: It
would have been enough for you to do thus.  Then he struck the ground with his
hands once and wiped his right hand with the help of his left hand and the exterior
of his palms and his face. 'Abdullah said: Didn't you see that Umar was not fully
satisfied with the words of 'Ammar only ?

Abd al-Rabmin b. Abza narrated It on the authority of his father that
a man came to 'Umar and said: I am (at times) affected by seminal emission but
find no water.  He ('Umar) told him not to say prayer.  'Ammar then said.  Do you
remember, 0 Commander of the Faithful, when I and you were in a military detachment
and we had had a seminal emission and did not find water (for taking bath) and you did
not say prayer, but as for myself I rolled in dust and said prayer, and (when it was
mentioned before) the Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: It was enough for you
to strike the ground with your hands and then blow (the dust) and then wipe your
