INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
The penal laws of Islam are called Hudud in the Hadith and Fiqh.  This word is
the plural of Hadd, which means prevention, hindrance, restraint, prohibition, and
hence a restrictive ordinance or statute of God, respecting things lawful and unlawful.
</p>
<p> Punishments are divided into two classes, one of which is called Hadd and
the other Ta'zir.  The Hadd is a measure of punishment defined by the Qur'an and
the Sunnah.  In Ta'zir, the court, is allowed to use its discretion in regard to the form
and measure in which such punishment is to be inflicted.</p>
<p> Punishments by way of Hadd are of the following forms: death by stoning,
amputation of a limb or limbs, flogging by one hundred or eighty strokes.  They are 
prescribed respectively for the following offences: adultery committed by married persons,
theft, highway robbery, drunkenness and slander imputing unchastity to women.</p>
<p>
   The punishments described above are the maximum punishments for the above
mentioned crimes.  These can be reduced keeping in view the circumstances in which
the crimes were committed, the nature of the evidence, and the motive of the criminal
with which he committed the crime.

punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this

men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there is

bread in his hand.  She said : Allah's Apostle, here is he as I have weaned him and he eats
food. He (the Holy Prophet) entrusted the child to one of the Muslims and then
pronounced punishment.  And she was put in a ditch up to her chest and he 
commanded people and they stoned her.  Khalid b Walid came forward with a stone
which he flung at her head and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and so he
abused her.  Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) heard his (Khalid's) curse that
he had huried upon her.  Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Khalid, be gentle.  By
Him in Whose Hand is my life, she has made such a repentance that even if a wrongful
tax-collector were to repent, he would have been forgiven.  Then giving command
regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried.

Imran b. Husain reported that a woman from Juhaina came to Allah's
Apostle (may peace be upon him) and she had become pregnant because of adultery.
She said: Allah's Apostle, I have done something for which (prescribed punishment)
must be imposed upon me, so impose that.  Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him)
called her master and said: Treat her well, and when she delivers bring her to me.  He
did accordingly.  Then Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) pronounced judgment
about her and her clothes were tied around her and then he commanded and she was
stoned to death.  He then prayed over her (dead body).  Thereupon Umar said to him:
Allah's Apostle, you offer prayer for her, whereas she had committed adultery ! Thereupon
he said: She has made such a repentance that if it were to be divided among
seventy men of Medina, it would be enough.  Have you found any repentance better
than this that she sacr ficed her life for Allah, the Majestic?

Abu Huraira and Zaid b Khalid al-Juhani reported that one of the desert
tribes came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of
Allah, I beg of you in the name of Allah that you pronounce judgment about me
according to the Book of Allah.  The second claimant who was wiser than him said:
Well, decide amongst us according to the Book of Allah, but permit me (to say
something).  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon ham) said: Say.  He
said: My son was a servant in the house of this person and he committed adultery
with his wife. I was informed that my son deserved stoning to death (as punishment
for this offence). I gave one hundred goats and a slave girl as ransom for this. I asked
the scholars (if this could serve as an expiation for this offence).  They informed me
that my son deserved one hundred lathes and exile for one year. and this woman
deserved stoning (as she was married).  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace he
upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life.  I will decide between you according
to the Book of Allah. The slave-girl and the goats should be given back, and
your son is to be punished with one hundred lashes and exile for one year. And, O
Unais (b.  Zuhaq al-Aslami), go to this woman in the morning, and if she makes a
confession, then stone her. He (the narrator) said: He went to her in the morning
and she made a confession.  And Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) made
pronouncement about her and she was stoned to death.

Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had committed adultery.  Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to the Jews and said: What do you find in
Torah for one who commits adultery?  They said: We darken their faces and make
them ride on the donkey with their faces turned to the opposite direction (and their
backs touching each other), and then they are taken round (the city).  He said: Bring
Torah if you are truthful.  They brought it and recited it until when they came to the
verse pertaining to stoning, the person who was reading placed his hand on the verse
pertaining to stoning, and read (only that which was) between his hands and what
was subsequent to that.  Abdullah b. Salim who was at that time with the Messenger
of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Command him (the reciter) to lift his hand.
He lifted it and there was, underneath that, the verse pertaining to stoning.  Allah's

they were stoned. Abdullah b. 'Umar said: I was one of those who stoned 
them, and I saw him (the Jew) protecting her (the Jewess) with his body.

Al-Bara' b. 'Azib reported: There happened to pass by Allah's Apostle
(may peace be upon him) a Jew blackened and lashed.  Allah's Apostle (may peace be
upon him) called them (the Jews) and said: Is this the punishment that you find in
your Book (Torah) as a prescribed punishment for adultery ? They said: Yes.  He (the
Holy Prophet) called one of the scholars amongst them and said: I ask you in the
name of Allah Who sent down the Torah on Moses if that is the prescribed punishment
for adultery that you find in your Book.  He said: No. Had you not asked me in the
name of Allah, I would not have given you this information.  We find stoning to death
(as punishment prescribed in the Torah).  But this (crime) became quite common
amongst our aristocratic class.  So when we caught hold of any rich person (indulging
in this offence) we spared him, but when we caught hold of a helpless person we
imposed the prescribed punishment upon him.  We then said : Let us argree (on a
punishment) which we can inflict both upon the rich and the poor.  So We decided to
blacken the face with coal and flog as a substitute punishment for stoning.  Thereupon
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, I am the first to revive
Thy command when they had made it dead.  He then commanded and he (the offender)
was stoned to death.  Allah, the Majestic and Glorious, sent down (this verse): "O
Messenger, (the behaviour of) those who vie with one another in denying the truth
should not grieve you . .." up to "is vouchsafed unto you, accept it" (v. 41)2176 It was
said (by the Jews): Go to Muhammad; it he commands you to blacken the face and award
flogging (as punishment for adultery), then accept it, but it he gives verdict for
stoning, then avoid it.  It was (then) that Allah, the Majestic and Great, sent down
(these verses): "And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has
revealed are, indeed, deniers of the truth" (v. 44); "And they who do not judge in
accordance with what Allah has revealed-they, they indeed are the wrongdoers"
