INTRODUCTION

<blockquote>
<p>
The word Hajj means, literally, repairing to a place for the sake of visit (al-qasd
li-ziyarah), and in the terminology of the Islamic Shari'ah, it implies the repairing to
Bait-Allah (the house of Allah) to observe the necessary devotion (iqamat-an-li-nusuk)
Bait-Allah is one of the names by which the Ka'ba is called.
<p>  
Hajj is not a new institution which Islam has introduced in its Shari'ah.  This
institution is as old as the Ka'ba itself which is called in the Holy Qur'an to be "the
first House of Divine Worship appointed for men" (iii. 95).  This verse of the Holy Qur'an
corroborates the hadith which tells us that the Ka'ba was first built by Adam, the
first man upon the earth.  It was later on rebuilt by Hadrat Ibrahim and his illustrious
son Hadrat Isma'il (peace be upon both of them).  And when Ibrahim and Isma'al raised
the foundations of the house, they said: "Our Lord ! accept from us" (ii. 127).  An
earlier revelation makes it clear that the Ka'ba was already there when Hadrat
Ibrahim left Hadrat Isma'il in the wilderness of Arabia: "Our Lord ! I have settled a
part of my offspring in a valley unproductive of fruit near Thy sacred House"(xiv. 37).

<p>
The whole ceremony of Hajj is commemorative of Hadrat Ibrahim and his family's
acts of devotion to God Almighty.  This shows that the Holy Prophet (may peace be
upon him) did not innovate this institution but purged it of all evil practices and made
it an obligatory act of piety by which one can develop God-consciousness.
<p>  
It is rightly said that it is the perfection of faith since it combines in itself all
the distinctive qualities of other obligatory acts.  It represents the quality of salat since
a pilgrim offers prayers in the Ka'ba, the House of the Lord.  It encourages the spending
of material wealth for the sake of the Lord, the chief characteristic of Zakat.  When a
pilgrim sets out for Hajj, he dissociates himself from his hearth and home, from his
dear and near ones to please the Lord.  He suffers privation and undertakes the hardship
of journey-the lessons we learn from fasting and i'tikaf. In Hajj one is trained to be
completely forgetful of the material comforts and show of worldly thing. One
has to sleep on stony ground, circumambulate the Ka'ba, run between Safa and Marwa
and spend his night and day wearing, only two pieces of unsewn cloth.  He is required
to avoid the use of oil or scent or any other perfume.  He is not even allowed to get
his hair cut or trim his beard. In short, he is commanded to abandon everything for
the sake of Allah and submit himself before his Lord, the ultimate aim of the life of a
Muslim.  In fact, physical pilgrimage is a prelude to spiritual pilgrimage to God, when
man would bid goodbye to everything of the world and present himself before Him as
His humble servant saying: "Here I am before Thee, my Lord, as a slave of Thine."
  
"Down through the ages." says Professor Hitti, "this institution has continued to
serve as the major unifying influence in Islam and the most effective common bond
among the diverse believers.  It rendered almost every capable Moslem perforce a
traveller for once in his lifetime.  The socializing influence of such a gathering of the
brotherhood of believers from the far quarters of the earth is hard to overestimate.
It afforded opportunity for negroes, Berbers, Chinese, Persians, Syrians, Turks-rich
and poor, high and low-to fraternize and meet together on the common ground of
faith" (History of the Arabs, p. 136).

you to see the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) receiving the revelations
'Umar lifted a corner of the cloth and I looked at him and he was emitting a
sound of snorting.  He (the narrator) said: I thought it was the sound of a camel.
When he was relieved of this he said: Where is he who asked about Umra?  When the
person came, the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Wash out the trace of
yellowness, or he said: the trace of perfume and put off the cloak and do in your 'Umra

the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him). (Once) when the Apostle of Allah (may
peace be upon him) was in Ji'rana and there was a cloth which provided shade over
him, and there were his Companions with him. 'Umar being one of them, there came a
person with a cloak of wool on him daubed with perfume and he said: Messenger of
Allah, what about the person who, entered upon the state of Ihram with a cloak after daub-
ing it with perfume ? The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) looked at him for
a short while, and then became quiet, and revelation began descending upon him, and
'Umar gestured (with his hand) to Ya'la b Umayya to come. Ya'la came and he enter-
ed his head (beneath the cloth and saw) the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)
with his face red, and breathing with a snore. Then he felt relieved (of that burden)
and he said: Where is the man who was just asking me about Umra ? The man was
searched for and he was brought, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him)
said: So far as the perfume is concerned, wash it three times, and remove the cloak
too (as it was sewn) and do in 'Umra as you do in Hajj.

said, Messenger of Allah, I put on Ihram for 'Umra: what should I do ? He (the Holy
Prophet) kept quiet and did not make him any reply. And 'Umar screened him and it
was (usual) with 'Umar that when the revelation descended upon him, he provided
him shade (with the help of a piece of cloth).  I (the person who came to the Holy
Prophet) said: I said to 'Umar I wish to project my head into the cloth (to see how
the Holy Prophet receives revelation).  So when the revelation began to descend upon
him 'Umar wrapped him (the Holy Prophet) with cloth I came to him and projected my
head with him into the cloth, and saw him (the Holy Prophet) (receiving the revelation).
When he (the Holy Prophet) was relieved (of its burden), he said: Where is the inquirer
who was just inquiring about 'Umra?  That man came to him.  Thereupon he (the
Apostle of Allah) said: Take off the cloak from (your body) and wash the traces of
perfume which were upon you, and do in 'Umra what you did in Hajj.

came on the 4th of Dhu'l-Hijja and he commanded us to put off Ihram.  'Ata'said that
he (Allah's Apostle) commanded them to put off Ihram and to go to their wives (for inter-
course).  'Ata' said: It was not obligatory for them, but (intercourse) with them had
become permissible.  We said: When only five days had been left to reach 'Arafa, he
(the Holy Prophet) commanded us to have intercourse with our wives.  And we reached
'Arafa in a state as if we had just intercoursed (with tbem). He ('Ata') said: Jabir
pointed with his hand and I (perceive) as if I am seeing his hand as it moved.  In the
  (meantime) the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood amongst us and said:
  You are well aware that I am the most God-fearing, most truthful and most pious
  amongst you.  And if there were not sacrificial animals with me, I would also have put
  off Ihram as you have put off.  And if I were to know this matter of mine what I have
  come to know later on.  I would not have brought sacrificial'animals with me. SO
  they (the Companions) put.olf Ihrim and we also put off and listened to (the Holy
  Prophet) and obeyed (his command). Jabir said: 'All came with the revenue of the
  taxes (from Yemen).  He (the Holy Prophet) said: For what (purpose) have you entered
  into the state of Ihram (whether you entered into the state purely for Hajj and
  ,Umra jointly or Hajj and Umra separately)?  He said: For the purpose for which the
  Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had entered. (The Holy Prophet had entered
  as a Qiran, i.e. Ihram covering both Umra and Hajj simultaneously.) Thereupon
  Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Offer a sacrifice of animal, and retain
  Ihram.  And 'All brought a sacrificial animal for him (for the Holy Prophet).  Suraqa b.
  Malik b. Ju'shum said: Messenger of Allah, is it (this concession putting off Ihram of
  Hajj or Umra) meant for this year or is it for ever?.He said: It is for ever.

  Ihram.  If there were not the sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as you do.
  So we put off the Ihram (after performing Umra), and we bad intercourse with our
  wives and did everything which a non-Muhrim does (applying perfume, putting on
  clothes, etc.), and when It was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) we turned our
  back to Mecca (in order to go to Mini, 'Arafat) and we put on lhram for Hajj.

and al-Marwa. and get your hair cut and stay as non-Muhrims.  When it was the day
of Tarwiya, then put on Ihram for Hajj and make lhram for Mut'a (you had put on
Ihram i f or Hajj, but take it off af ter perf orming Umra and then again put on Ihram
for Hajj).  They said: How should we make it Mut'a although we entered upon lhram in
the name of Hajj?  He said: Do whatever I command you to do. Had I not brought
sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as I have commanded you to do.  But it
is not permissible for me to put off Ihram till tLe sacrifice is offered.  Then they also
did accordingly.

 FAREWELL PILGRIMAGE OF THE APOSTLE OF ALLAH (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM) 
</font></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
Just as the first revelation in the cave of Hira' marks the advent of the apostolic mission 
of Muhammad (May peace be upon him), similarly his Farewell Pilgrimage marks its crowning 
glory. Opinions differ as to when Hajj became obligatory but the commonly accepted opinion 
is that it was in the eighth year of Hijra that Allah declared it as one of the five 
fundamentals of Islam.  In the ninth year of Hijra the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) 
sent Abu Bakr as the leader of the Hajj delegation but he himself did not go. Hadrat Abu 
Bakr was later on joined by Hadrat Ali in order to make a sure declaration on behalf of 
the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) which concerned the freedom from obligation in 
regard to those idolatrous tribes who had shown no respect for the treaties which they 
had entered into with the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him).  This declaration is 
contains in the opening verses of Sura Tauba.
<p>
  The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) spent this year in making preparations for the 
Hajj in the tenth year of Hijra which coincided with the sixty-third year (the last year) 
of his life.  Every attempt was, therefore, made to take full advantage of this great 
assembly.  Messengers were sent to all parts of Arabia inviting people to join him in this 
great Pilgrimage.  It was necessary for them since they should learn by first-hand knowledge 
the several injunctions and practices of the Pilgrimage-free from all taints of ignorance-an 
ideal pattern which was to be kept intact in its pristine glory for all times to come.  
Not only the rites and rituals of the Pilgrimage were to be finally explained by the 
Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) but all those things which had any concern with 
Islam had been finalized.
<p>
The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) delivered a khutba on the 24th of Dhi-Qa'da on 
the occasion of the Friday prayer and gave the Muslims necessary instructions relating 
to Hajj.  Next day, I.e. on the 25th of Dhi-Qa'da, he set out after Zuhr prayer on a 
journey for Hajj along with thousands of his devoted Companions.  The 'Asr prayer was 
offered at Dhu'l-Hulaifa.  The caravan spent the night there and it was there after 
the Zuhr prayer that the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) and his Companions put 
on Ihram and proceeded towards Mecca.  They reached their destination on the 4th of 
Dhu'l-Hijja pronouncing Talbiya <i>(Labbaik, Labbaik, Allahumma Labbaik).</i>
<p>
  As the caravan moved on the number of participants swelled till, according to some 
of the narrators, it reached more than one lakh and thirty thousands.  The Farewell 
Pilgrimage is one of the most important occasions in the sacred life of Muhammad (May 
peace be upon him).  Apart from the rites and rituals, the addresses and speeches of 
the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) succinctly sum up the teachings of Islam.

<p>  
Ja'far b Muhammad reported on the authority of his father: We went to Jabir b. 
Abdullah and he began inquiring about the people (who had gone to see him) till it 
was my turn.  I said: I am Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Husain.  He placed his hand upon my 
head and opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed his palm on 
my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during those days, a young boy, and he 
said: You are welcome, my nephew.  Ask whatever you want to ask.  And I asked him but 
as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer came.  
He stood up covering himself in his mantle.  And whenever he placed its ends upon his 
shoulders they slipped down on account of being short
(in size).  Another mantle was, however, lying on the clothes rack near by.  And he 
led us in the prayer.  I said to him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah's Messenger 
(May peace be upon him).  And he pointed with his hand nine, and then stated: The 
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but 
did not perform Hajj, then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the 
effect that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to perform the 
Hajj.  A large number of persons came to Medina and all of them were anxious to 
follow the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and do according to his doing.  
We set out with him till we reached Dhu'l-Hulaifa.  Asma' daughter of Umais gave birth 
to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr. She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon 
him) asking him: What should 1 do?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage 
your private parts and put on Ihram.  The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) 
then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect 
with him on its back at al-Baida'.  And I saw as far as I could see in front of me 
but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my left and behind me like 
this.  And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was prominent among us and 
the (revelation) of the Holy Qur'an was descending upon him .  And it is he who 
knows (its true) significance.  And whatever he did, we also did that. He pronounced 
the Oneness of Allah (saying): "Labbaik, 0 Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik. Thou hast no 
partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner." 
And the people also pronounced this Talbiya which they pronounce (today).  The Messenger 
of Allah (May peace be upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the 
Messenger of Allah (May peace.be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiya. Jabir (Allah 
be pleased with him) said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only,
 being unaware of the Umra (at that season), but when we came with him to the House, 
he touched the pillar and (made seven circuits) running three of them and walking four.  
And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, 
he recited:
"And adopt the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer." And this Station was between him and 
the House.  My father said (and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was
 from Allah's Apostle [May peace be upon him] that he recited in two rak'ahs: "say: He is Allah
 One," and say: "Say: 0 unbelievers." He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed 
it. He then went out of the gate to al-Safa' and as he reached near it he recited: "Al-Safa' 
and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah," (adding:) I begin with what Allah 
(has commanded me) to begin.  He first mounted al-Safa' till he saw the House, and facing 
Qibla he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said: "There is no god but 
Allah, One, there is no partner with Him.  His is the Sovereignty. to Him praise is due. 
and He is Powerful over everything.  There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His 
promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone." He then made supplication 
in the course of that saying such words three times.  He then descended and walked towards 
al-Marwa, and when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began 
to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at al-Safa'.  And 
when it was his last running at al-Marwa he said: If I had known beforehand what I have come
 to know afterwards, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have performed 
an 'Umra.  So, he who among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off 
Ihram and treat it as an Umra.  Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju'sham got up and said: Messenger of 
Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply forever?  Thereupon the Messenger 
of Allah (May peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into another and said 
twice: The 'Umra has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding): "No, but for ever and ever." 
'All came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (May peace be upon 
him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one among those who had put off 
Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Hadrat'Ali) showed disapproval 
to it, whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this.  He (the narrator) said 
that 'Ali used to say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 
showing annoyance at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah's 
Messenger (may peace be upon him) regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him 
that I was angry with her, whereupon he said: She has told the truth, she has told the 
truth. (The Holy Prophet then asked 'Ali): What did you say when you undertook to go for
 Hajj?  I ('Ali) said: 0 Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy 
Messenger has put it on.  He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put 
off the Ihram.  He (Jabir) said: The
total number of those sacrificial animals brought by 'Ali from the Yemen and of those 
brought by the Apostle (may peace be upon him) was one hundred.  Then all the people
 except the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and those who had with them sacrificial 
animals, put off Ihram , and got their hair clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiya 
(8th of Dhu'l-Hijja) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger 
of Ailah (may peace be upon him) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sunset 'Isha' and 
dawn prayers.  He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of 
hair should be pitched at Namira.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then 
set out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (the 
sacred site) as the Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period.  The Messenger of 
Allah (may peace be upon him), however, passed on till he came to 'Arafa and he found 
that the tent had been pitched for him at Namira.  There he got down till the sun had 
passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought and saddled for him.
  Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your 
blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours,
 in this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold ! Everything pertaining to the 
Days of Ignorance is under my feet completely abolished.  Abolished are also the 
blood-revenges of the Days. of Ignorance.  The first claim of ours on blood-revenge 
which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith, who was nursed among the 
tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhail.  And the usury of she pre-Islamic period is 
abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib, 
for it is all abolished.  Fear Allah concerning women ! Verily you have taken them on
 the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by 
words of Allah. You too have right over them, and that they should not allow anyone 
to sit on your bed whom you do not like.  But if they do that, you can chastise them
 but not severely.  Their rights upon 
you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have 
left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold fast to it, you would never go astray.  
And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what would 
you say?  They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have conveyed (the 
message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel.  
He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the 
sky and pointing it at the people (said): "O Allah, be witness. 0 Allah, be witness,"
 saying it thrice. (Bilal then) pronounced Adhan and later on Iqama and he (the Holy 
Prophet) led the noon prayer.  He (Bilal) then uttered Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet)
 led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two.  The 
Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then mounted his camel and came to the place 
of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa, turn towards the side where there we  are rocks,
 having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qibla.  
He kept standing there till the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, 
and the disc of the sun had disappeared.  He made Usama sit behind him, and he pulled 
the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to 
keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with his right hand 
to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of 
sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and 
this is how he reached al-Muzdalifa.  There he led the evening and 'Isha prayers with 
one Adhan and two Iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i.e. he did not 
observe supererogatory rak'ahs between Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers).  The Messenger of 
Allah (may peace be upon him) then lay down till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with 
an Adhan and Iqama when the morning light was clear.  He again mounted al-Qaswa, and 
when he came to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qibla, supplicated Him, Glorified 
Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illa Allah) and Oneness, and kept standing
 till the daylight was very clear.  He then went quickly before the sun rose, and 
seated behind him was al-Fadl b. 'Abbas and he was a man having beautiful hair and fair 
complexion and handsome face.  As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him)
 was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side by side with them).
 Al-Fadl began to look at them.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) 
placed his hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his face to the other side, 
and began to see, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) turned his 
hand to the other
side and placed it on the face of al-Fadl.  He again turned his face to the other 
side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir.1680 He urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, 
and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest jamra, he came 
to the jamral682which is near the tree.  At this be threw seven small pebbles, saying 
Allah-o-Akbar while throwing every one of them in a manner in which the small pebbles 
are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley.
 He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his 
own hand.1694 Then he gave the remaining number to 'All who sacrificed them, and he 
shared him in his sacrifice.  He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal 
sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Holy Prophet and
 Hadrat 'All) took some meat out of it and drank its soup.  The Messenger of Allah 
(May peace be upon him) again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca.  He came to the tribe of Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water. 0 Bani 'Abd al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, 1 would have drawn it along with you.  So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.

Commander of the Believers is about to come to you, and you

he drove the sacrificial animals with him from Dhu'l-Hulaifa.  Allah's Messenger

sacrificial animals which they had brought with them, whereas some of them had 
none to sacrifice.  So when Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to 
Mecca, he said to the people: He who amongst you has brought sacrificial animals

him till he has completed the Hajj; and he,who amongst you has not brought the 
sacrificial animals should circumambulate the House, and run between al-Safa'

the Ihram for Hajj and offer sacrifice of animals.  But he who does not find the 
sacrificial animal, he should observe fast for three days during the Hajj and for 
seven days when he returns to his family.  Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon

(of the Ka'ba containing the Black Stone), then ran in three circuits out of seven 
and walked in four circuits.  And then when he had finished the circumambulation of 
the House he observed two rak'ahs of prayer at  the Station (of Ibrahim), and then 
pronounced Salaam (for concluding the rak'ahs), and departed and came to al-Safa' 
and ran seven times between al-Safa' and al-Marwa.  After that he did not treat 
anything as lawful which had become unlawful till he had completed his Hajj and 
sacrificed his animal on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu'l-Hijja). and then went 
back quickly (to Mecca) and performed circumambulation of the House (known as tawaf 
ifada) after which all that was unlawful for him became lawful; and those who had 
brought the sacrificial animals along with them did as Allah's Messenger (may peace

Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Rahman reported: A person from Iraq said to him 
to inquire from 'Urwa b. Zubair for him whether a person who puts on Ihram for Hajj
 is allowed to put it off or not as he circumambulates the House.  And if he says: "No, it
 can't be put off," then tell him that there is a person who makes such an assertion. 
He (Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Rahman) then said: I asked him ( Urwa b. Zubair), where-
 upon he said: The person who has entered into the state of Ihram for Hajj cannot
get out of it unless he has, completed the Hajj I (further) said (to him):  (What) if a
 person makes that assertion?  Thereupon he said : It is indeed unfortunate that he
 makes such an assertion.  That person ('Iraqi) then met me and he asked me and I
narrated to him (the reply of 'Urwa), whereupon he (the Iraqi) said: Tell him ('Urwa)
 that a person had informed him that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had
done that; and why is it that Asma' and Zubair have done like this?  He (Muhammad b.
 'Abd al-Rahman) said: I went to him and made a mention of that to him, whereupon
 he ('Urwa) said: Who is he (the 'Iraqi) ? I said: I do not know, whereupon he said: What
 is the matter that he does not come to me himself and ask me? I suppose he is an
'Iraqi.  I said: I do not know, whereupon he said: He has told a lie.  Allah's Messenger
 (may peace be upon him) performed Hajj, and 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) has
 told me that the first thing with which he commenced (the rituals) when he arrived at
Mecca was that he performed ablution and then circumambulated the Ka'ba.  Then
Abu Bakr performed Hajj and the first thing with which he commenced (the Hajj) as
 the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and nothing besides it.  So did 'Umar.  Then
 'Uthman performed Hajj and I saw that the first thing with which he commenced
 the Hajj was the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and nothing besides it. Then
  Mu'awiya and Abdullah b. 'Umar did that.  Then I performed Hajj with my father
  Zubair b. al-'Awwam, and the first thing with which he commenced (Hajj) was the
  circumambulation of the House.  He then did nothing besides it. I then saw the
  emigrants (Muhajirin) and the helpers (Ansar) doing like this and nothing besides it.
  And the last one whom I saw doing like this was Ibn 'Umar.  And he did not break it
  (the Hajj) after performing 'Umra.  And Ibn 'Umar is with them.  Why don't they ask
  him (to testify it)?  And none amongst those who had passed away commenced (the
  rituals of Hajj) but by circumambulating the Ka'ba on their (first arrival) and they
  did not put off Ihram (without completing the Hajj), and I saw my mother and my
  aunt commencing (their Hajj) with the circumambulation of the House, and they did
  not put off Ihram. My mother informed me that she came and her sister, and Zubair and
  so and so for 'Umra, and when they had kissed the corner (the Black Stone, after Sa'i
  and circumambulation), they put off Ihram.  And he (the 'Iraqi) has told a lie in this

is no harm for him, that he should not circumambulate between them." It (this verse)
has been revealed about the people of Ansar.  Whenever they pronounced the Talbiya,
they pronounced it in the name of al-Manat during the Days of Ignorance; so they
(thought) that it was not permissible for them (for the Muslims) to circumambulate
between and al-Marwa. When they (the Muslims) came with Allah's Apostle
(may peace he upon him) for Hajj, they mentioned it to him.  So Allah, the Exalted
and Majestic, revealed this verse.  By my life, Allah will not complete the Hajj of one
who has not circumambulated between al-Safa and al-Marwa.

'Urwa b. Zabair reported: I said to 'A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle
(may peace be upon him): I do not see any (fault) in one who does not circumambl"te
between al-Safa' and al-Marwa, and I do not mind if I do not circumambulate between
them, whereupon she said: O, the son of my sister, what you say is wrong.  Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) observed Sa'i and so did the Muslims.  So it is a
Sunnah (of the Prophet). And it was a common practice (with the pagan Arabs) that
those who pronounced Talbiya for the wretched al-Manat, situated at Mushalla, did
not observe Sa'i between al-Safa' and al-Marwa.  With the advent of Islam, we asked
Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) about this practice, and (it was on this
occasion) that Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse: "Verily al-Safa'
and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah"; so he who performed Hajj or  'Umra it
is no sin on him if he circumambulates them.  And if it were as you state, (then the
wording would have been): "There is no harm for him, that he should not 
circumambulate round them." Zuhri said: I made a mention of that to Abu Bakr b. 'Abd al-
Rahman b. al-Harith b. Hisham; he was impressed by that and said: This is what is
called knowledge.  And I have heard many a scholar saying: Many of the Arabs who
did not circumambulate between al-Safa' and al-Marwa caid: Our circumambulation
between these two hills is an act of ignorance; whereas others among the Ansar said:
We have been commanded to circumambulate the House, and not Commanded to run
between al-Safa' and al-Marwa. So Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed thia
verse: "Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah." Abu Bakr b. 'Abd

  Mini) and the stoned at al-Jamra.  She then prayed in her place.  I said to her: Respected 
lady, we set forth (in the very early part of dawn) when it was dark, whereupon
  she said: My son, there is no harm in it; Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) had
  granted permission to women. This hadith has been narrated by Ibn Juraij with the

  My son, Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) granted permission to women."
