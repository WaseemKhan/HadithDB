'Amr b. Sharid reported his father as saying : One day when I rode ehind
Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), he said (to me) : Do you remember any
Poetry of Umayya b. Abu Salt. I said : Yes. He said: Then go on. I recited a
couplet, and he said :    Go on. Then I again recited a couplet and he said : Go on. I
recited  one hundred couplets (of his poetry).  This hadith has been reported on the
authority of Sharid  through another chain of transmitters but with a slight variation
of wording.
