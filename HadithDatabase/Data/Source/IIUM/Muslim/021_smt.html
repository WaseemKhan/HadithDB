'Adi b. Hatim reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, I set off trained
dogs  and they catch for me (the game) and I recite the came of Allah over it (I
slaughter the game by reciting Bismillah-i-Allah-o-Akbar), whereupon he said: When you
set off your trained dogs and you recited the name of Allah (while setting them off), then
eat (the game). I said: Even if them (the trained dogs) kill that (the game)?  He (the
Holy Prophet) said: Even if these kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which
you did not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said
to him: I throw Mi'rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the
game).  Thereupon he said:  When you throw Mi'rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it
falls flatly (and beats the game to death), then do not eat that.

we do)?  Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: When you set of your trained dogs
having recited the name of Allah, then eat what these (hounds) have caught for
you, oven if it (the game) is killed, provided (the hunting dog) has not eaten (any part
of the game). If it has eaten (the game), then you don't eat it as I fear that it might
have caught for its own self.  And do not eat in case other dogs have joined your

strikes (the game) with its point, then eat, but if it strikes flatly and it dies, that is
Waqidh (beaten into death), do not eat that.  I asked the Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him) about (hunting with the help of) dogs, whereupon he said.  When
you send your dog (for hunting) reciting the name of Allah, then eat (the game), but
if some part of it is eaten (by the dogs, then do not eat that, for it (your dog) has
caught that (the-game) for itself.  I (again) said: If I find along with my dog another
dog, and do not know which of (the dogs) has caught (the game). then (what should I
do) ? Thereupon he ('Allah's Messenger) said: Then don't eat that, for you recited the
name of Allah on your dog and not on the other one.

of the Quraish and provided us with a bag of dates.  And he found for us nothing besides
it. Abu Ubaida gave each of us one date (everyday).  I (Abu Zubair, one of the
narrators) said: What did you do with that?  He said: We sucked that just as a baby
sucks and then drank water over that, and it sufficed us for the day until night. We
beat off leaves with the help of our staffs, then drenched them with water and ate
them.  We then went to the coast of the sea, and there rose before us on the coast of
the sea something like a big mound.  We came near that and we found that it was a
beast, called al-'Anbar (spermaceti whale).  Abu 'Ubaida said.  It is dead.  He then
said: No (but it does not matter), we have been sent by the Messenger of Allah (may
peace be upon him) in the path of Allah and you are hard pressed (on account of the
scarcity of food), so you eat that.  We three hundred in number stayed there for a
month, until we grew bulky.  He (Jabir) said: I saw how we extracted pitcher after
pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and sliced from it compact piece of meat
equal to a bull or like a bull.  Abu 'Ubaida called forth thirteen men from us and he
made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he took hold of one of the ribs of its chest
and made it stand and then saddled the biggest of the camels we had with us and it
passed under it (the arched rib), and we provided ourselves with pieces of boiled meat
(especially for use in our journey).  When we came back to Medina, we went to Allah's
Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to him, whereupon
he said: That was a provision which Allah had brought forth for you.  Is there any
piece of meat (left) with you, so tnat you give to us that ? He (Jabir) said: We sent

stayed on the coast for half a month, and were so much afflicted by extreme hunger
that we (were obliged) to eat leaves.  That is why it was called the Detachment of the
Leaves.  The ocean cast out for us an animal which was called al-'Anbar (whale).  We
ate of that for half of the month and rubbed its fat on our (bodies) until our bodies
became stout.  Abu 'Ubaida caught hold of one of its ribs and fixed that up.  He
then cast a glance at the tallest man of the army and the highest of the camels. and
then made him ride over that, and that-tnan passed beneath it (the rib), and many a
man could sit in its eye-socket, and we extracted many pitchers of fat from the
cavity of its eye.  We had small bags containing dates with us (before finding the
whale).  'Ubaida gave every person amongst us a handful of dates (and when the
provision ran short), he then gave each one of us one date.  And when that (stock)
