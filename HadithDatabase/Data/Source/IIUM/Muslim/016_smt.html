<p> 
Sahl b. Abu Hathma and Rafi' b. Khadij reported that 'Abdullah b. Sahl b.
Zaid and Muhayyisa b. Mas'ud b. Zaid went out and as they reached Khaibar they were
separated.  Then Muhayyisa found 'Abdullah b. Sahl having been killed.  He buried him,
and then came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him).  They were Huwayyisa b.
Mas'ud and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl, and he (the latter one) was the youngest of the
people (those three who had come to seek an interview with the Holy Prophet) began
to talk before his Companions (had spoken).  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace
be upon him) said: The eldest one (eldest in regard to age should speak).  So he kept
quiet, and his companions (Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa) began to speak, and he ('Abd
al Rahman) spoke along with them and they narrated to Allah's Messenger (may
peace be upon him) the murder of 'Abdullah b. Sahl.  Thereupon he said to them: Are
you prepared to take fifty oaths so that you may be entitled (to blood-wit) of your
companion (or your man who has murdered)? They said: How can we take an oath
on a matter which we have not witnessed?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews
will exonerate themselves by fifty oaths.  They said: How can we accept the oaths of
people who are unbelievers?  When Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw
that, he himself paid his blood-wit.

Sahl. b. Abu Hathma and Rafi' b. Khadij reported that Muhayyisa b. Mas'ud
and 'Abdullah b. Sahl went towards Khaibar and they separated near the palm-trees.
'Abdullah b. Sahl was killed.  They accused the Jews (for this act).  And there came to
Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) his brother (the brother of the slain person)
'Abd al-Rahman and his cousins Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa; and 'Abd al-Rahman
talked to him about the matter pertaining to (the murder of) his brother, and he was
the youngest among them. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
said:Show regard for the greatness of the old, or he said: Let the eldest begin
speaking.  Then they (Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa) spoke about the matter of their
companion (murder of their cousin, 'Abdullah b. Sahl).  Thereupon Allah's Messenger
(may peace be upon him) said: Let fifty (persons) among you take oath for levelling the
charge (of murder) against a person amongst them, and he would be surrendered to
you.  They said: We have not witnessed this matter ourselves.  How can we then take
oath?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: The Jews will exonerate themselves by the oaths
of fifty of them.  They said: Messenger of Allah, they are non-believing people.  
Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) paid the blood wit for him.  Sahl
said: As one day I entered the fold a she-camel amongst those camels hit me with its leg.

were we present there.  Thereupon (Allah's Messenger is reported to have said): Then

 Muhayyisa went out to Khaibar under some distress which had afflicted them.
 Muhayyisa came and informed that Abdutlah b. Sahl had been killed, and (his dead

 Allah, it is you who have killed him.  They said: By Allah, we have not killed him.
 He then came to his people, and made mention of that to them.  Then came he and
 his brother Huwayyisa, and he was older than he, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl.  Then
 Muhayyisa went to speak, and it was he who had accompanied ('Abdullah) to Khaibar,

 greatness of the great (he meant the seniority of age).  Then Huwayyisa spoke
 and then Muhayyisa also spoke.  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon
 him) said: They should either pay blood-wit for your companion, or be prepared
 for war. Allah's  Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote about it to them (to the
 Jews).  They wrote: Verily, by Allah, we have not killed him.  Thereupon Allah's
 Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa and Abd al-Rahman: 
Are you prepared to take oath in order to entitle yourselves for the blood-wit
 of your companion?  They said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will take
 oath (of their innocence).  They said: They are not Muslims.  Allah's Messenger (may

 one hundred camels until they entered into their houses, Sahl said: One red she-camel

Abu Bakra reported that (in the Farewell Address) Allah's Apostle (may
peace be upon him) said: Time has completed a cycle and come to the state of the day
when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is constituted of twelve
months,of which four are sacred; three of them consecutive, viz. Dhu'l-Qa'da, Dhu'l-
Hijja and Muharram, and also Rajab the month of Mudar which comes between
Jumada and Sha'ban.  He (the Holy Prophet) then said: which month is this?  We said
Allah and His Messenger know best.  He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet)
remained silent for some time until we thought that he would give it a name other
than that (by which it was known).  He said: Is it not Dha'l-Hijja?  We said: Yes.  He
(the Holy Prophet) said: Which city is this?  We said: Allah and His Messenger know
best.  He (the Holy Prophety remained silent until we thought that he would give it
another name.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it not the Balda (the city of Mecca)?
We said: Yes. He said: What day is this?  We said: Allah and His Messenger know
best.  He (the Holy Prophet) remained silent until we thought that he would give it
another name.  He said: Is it not the Day of Sacrifice?  We said: Allah's Messenger.
yes.  Thereupon he said: Your blood, your property (Muhammad, one of the narrators,
said: I think, he also said this) and your honour are sacred to you like the sacredness
of this day of yours, in this city of yours, and in this month of yours.  You will soon
meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds.  So do not turn after me 
unbelievers (or misguided), some of you striking the necks of the others.  Behold I let him
who is present convey to him who is absent, for many a one whom a message is 
conveyed has a more retentive memory than one who hears.  He again said: Behold! have
I not delivered (the message) to you?  This hadith has been narrated through another
chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of words.
