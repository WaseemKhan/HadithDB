<p>
It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that the first man who 
discussed about Qadr(Divine Decree) in Basra was Ma'bad al-Juhani. I along
with Humaid b. 'Abdur-Rahman Himyari set out for prilgrimage or for 'Umrah and said:
Should it so happen that we come into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of 
Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him a
bout what is talked about Taqdir (Division Decree). Accidentally we came across Abdullah ibn 
Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. 
One of us (stood) on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion 
would authorize me to speak.  I therefore said: Abu Abdur Rahman! there have appeared 
some people in our land who recite the Holy Qur'an and pursue knowledge.  
And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that there is no 
such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined.  He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When 
you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have 
nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my (belief). 
Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe 
in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and then, it 
(in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. 
He further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the 
company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in 
pure white clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None 
amongst us recognized him. 
At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms on 
his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon 
him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad 
is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, 
and perform pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the 
journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. 
He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he would put the question and then he would 
himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He (the Holy 
Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His 
Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about good 
and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: Inform 
me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you worship 
Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you.  He (the 
enquirer) again said: Inform me about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: 
One who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring (about it). He (the inquirer) 
said: Tell me some of its indications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will 
give birth to her mistress and master, that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herds 
vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings. 
He (the narrator, Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) went on his way but I 
stayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while. He then, said to me: Umar, do you know 
who this inquirer was? I replied: Allah and His Apostle knows best. He (the Holy Prophet) 
remarked: He was Gabriel (the angel). He came to you in order to instruct you in matters of 
religion.

It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that when Ma'bad discussed the 
problem pertaining to Divine Decree, we refuted that.  He (the narrator) said: I and

the purport of the hadith related by Kahmas and its chain of transmission too, and there

<p> 
Abu Huraira reported: One day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) appeared 
before the public that a man came to him and said: Prophet of Allah, (tell me) what 
is Iman.  Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in 
Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Messengers and that you affirm your 
faith in the Resurrection hereafter.  He (again) said: Messenger of Allah, (tell me) 
what does al-Islam signify. He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Al-Islam signifies that 
you worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him and you establish obligatory 
prayer and you pay the obligatory poor-rate (Zakat) and you observe the fast of Ramadan.  
He (the inquirer) again said: Messenger of Allah, what does al-Ihsan 
imply ? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, 
and in case you fail to see Him, then observe prayer (with this idea in your mind) that 
(at least) He is seeing you. He (the inquirer ) again said: Messenger of Allah, when 
would there be the hour (of Doom) ? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: The one who is 
asked about it is no better informed than the inquirer. I, however, narrate some of 
its signs (and these are): when the slave-girl will give birth to he master, when the 
naked, barefooted would become the chiefs of the people - these are some of the signs 
of (Doom). (Moreover) when the shepherds of the black (camels) would exult themselves 
in buildings, this is one of the signs of (Doom). (Doom) is one of the five (happenings 
wrapped in the unseen) which no one knows but Allah.  Then he (the Messenger of Allah) 
recited (the verse) : "Verily Allah! with Him alone is the knowledge of the hour and He 
it is Who sends (down the rain) and knows that which is in the wombs and no person knows 
whatsoever he shall earn tomorrow, and a person knows not in whatsoever land he shall 
die. Verily Allah is Knowing, Aware .  He (the narrator, Abu Huraira) said: Then the 
person turned back and went away.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: 
Bring that man back to me.  They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet present there) went 
to bring him back, but they saw nothing there.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah 
remarked : he was Gabriel, who came to teach the people their religion.

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (may peace 
be upon him) said: Ask me (about matters pertaining to religion), but they (the Companions 
of the Holy Prophet) were too much overawed out of profound respect for him to ask him 
(anything).  In the meanwhile a man came there, and sat near his knees and said: Messenger 
of Allah, what al-lslam is?-to which he (the Holy Prophet)replied: You must not associate 
anything with Allah, and establish prayer, pay the poor-rate (Zakat) and observe (the fasts) 
of Ramadan.  He said : You (have) told the truth.  He (again) said: Messenger of Allah, 
what al-Iman (the faith) is?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you affirm your faith in 
Allah, His angels, His Books, His meeting, His Apostles, and that you believe in 
Resurrection and that you believe in Qadr (Divine Decree) in all its entirety, He (the 
inquirer) said: You (have) told the truth.  He (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what 
al-Ihsan is?  Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Al-Ihsan implies) that you fear 
Allah as if you are seeing Him, and though you see Him not, verily He is seeing you.  
He (the inquirer) said: You(have) told the truth.  He (the inquirer) said: When there 
would be the hour (of Doom)? (Upon this) he (the HolyProphet said:The one who is being 
asked about it is no better informed than the inquirer himself.  I,however,narrate some 
of its signs (and these are):when you see a slave(woman)giving birth to her master - that 
is one of the signs of (Doom); when you see barefooted, naked, deaf and dumb (ignorant and 
foolish persons) as the rulers of the earth - that is one of the signs of the Doom.  And 
when you see the shepherds of black camels exult in buildings - that is one of the signs 
of Doom.  The (Doom) is one of the five things (wrapped) in the unseen.  No one knows them 
except Allah. Then(the Holy Prophet) recited (the folowing verse): "Verily Allah ! with Him 
alone is the knowledge of the hour and He it is Who sends down the rain and knows that 
which is in the wombs and no person knows whatsoever he shall earn on morrow and a person
knows not in whatsoever land he shall die.  Verily Allah is Knowing,Aware.  He (the narrator,
Abu Huraira) said: Then the person stood up an (made his way).  The Messenger of Allah (may 
peace be upon him) said: Bring him back to me.  He was searched for, but they (the Companions
of the Holy Prophet) could not find him.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be 
upon him) thereupon said: He was Gabriel and he wanted to teach you (things pertaining
to religion) when you did not ask (them yourselves).

to Islam.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Five prayers during 
the day and the night. (Upon this he said: Am I obliged to say any other (prayer)
 besides these?  He (the Holy Prophet,) said: No, but whatever you observe voluntarily, 
out of your own free will, and the fasts of Ramadan.  The inquirer said: Am I obliged 
to do anything else besides this?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: No, but whatever you do 
out of your own free will. And the Messenger of Allah told him about the Zakat 
(poor-rate).  The inquirer said: Am I obliged to pay anything else besides this ? He 
(the Holy Prophet) said: No, but whatever you pay voluntarily out of your own free 
will.  The man turned back and was saying: I would neither make any addition to this, 
nor will decrease anything out of it.  The Prophet remarked: He is successful, if he 
is true to what he affirms.

It is reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that he said: We were
forbidden that we should ask anything (without the genuine need) from the Holy Prophet.  
It, therefore, pleased us that an intelligent person from the dwellers of the desert 
should come and asked him (the Holy Prophet) and we should listen to it.  A man from 
the dwellers of the desert came (to the Holy Prophet) and said: Muhammad, your 
messenger came to us and told us your assertion that verily Allah had sent you 
(as a prophet).  He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He told the truth.  He (the bedouin) 
said: Who created the heaven?  He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah.  He (the bedouin 
again) said: Who created the earth?  He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. He (the 
bedouin again) said: Who raised these mountains and who created in them whatever is 
created there?  He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah.  Upon this he (the bedouin) 
remarked: By Him Who created the heaven and created the earth and raised mountains 
thereupon, has Allah (in fact) sent you?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes.  He (the 
bedouin) said: Your messenger also told us that five prayers (had been made) 
obligatory for us during the day and the night.  He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: 
He told you the truth.  He (the bedouin) said: By Him Who sent you, is it Allah Who 
ordered you about this (i.e. prayers)?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes.  He (the 
bedouin) said: Your messenger told us that Zakat had been made obligatory in our 
riches.  He (the Holy Prophet) said.  He has told the truth.  He (the bedouin) said: 
By Him Who sent you (as a prophet), is it Allah Who ordered you about it (Zakat)?  
He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes.  He (the bedouin) said: Your messenger told us that 
it had been made obligatory for us to fast every year during the month of Ramadan.  
He (the Holy Prophet) said: He has told the truth.  He (the bedouin) said: By Him 
Who sent you (as a prophet), is it Allah Who ordered you about it (the fasts of 
Ramadan)?  He  (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes.  He (the bedouin) said: Your messenger 
also told us that pilgrimage (Hajj) to the House (of Ka'bah) had been made obligatory 
for him who is able to undertake the journey to it.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes.  
The narrator said that he (the bedouin) set off (at the conclusion of this answer, but 
at the time of his departure) remarked:'By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I would
neither make any addition to them nor would I diminish anything out of them.  Upon this 
the Holy Prophet remarked: If he were true (to what he said) he must enter Paradise.

It is reported on the authority of Qatada that one among the delegates of the 
'Abdul-Qais tribe narrated this tradition to him.  Sa'id said that Qatada had 
mentioned the name of Abu Nadra on the authority of Abu Sa'id Khudri who narrated 
this tradition: That people from the- tribe of 'Abdul-Qais came to the Messenger 
of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, we belong to the 
tribe of Rabi'a and there live between you and us the unbelievers of the Mudar 
tribe and we find it impossible to come to you except in the sacred months; direct 
us to a deed which we must communicate to those who have been left behind us and 
by doing which we may enter heaven.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be 
upon him) said: I enjoin upon you four (things) and forbid you to do four (things): 
worship Allah and associate none with Him, establish prayer, pay Zakat, and observe 
the fast of Ramadan, and pay the fifth part out of the booty. And I prohibit you 
from four (things): dry gourds, green-coloured jars, hollowed stumps of palm-trees, 
and receptacles.  They (the members of the delegation) said: Do you know what al-naqir 
is?  He replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out and in which you throw small 
dates.Sa'id said: He (the Holy Prophet) used the word tamar (dates). (The Holy Prophet 
then added): Then you sprinkle water over it and when its ebullition subsides, you 
drink it (and you are so intoxicated) that one amongst you, or one amongst them (the 
other members of your tribe, who were not present there) strikes his cousin with the 
sword. He (the narrator) said: There was a man amongst us who had sustained injury on 
this very account due to (intoxication), and he told that he tried to conceal it out 
of shame from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I, however, inquired 
from the Messenger of Allah (it we discard those utensils which you have forbidden 
us to use), then what type of vessels should be used for drink?  He (the Holy 
Prophet) replied: In the waterskin the mouths of which are tied (with a string).  
They (again) said: Prophet of Allah, our land abounds in rats and water-skins cannot 
remain preserved.  The holy Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: (Drink in 
water-skins) even if these arenibbled by rats. And then (addressing) al-Ashajj 
of 'Abdul-Qais he said: Verily, you possess two such qualities which Allah 
loves: insight and deliberateness.

beverage is good for us?  He (the Prophet) said: (Not to speak of beverages, I

persons) was left even with a single empty vessel. He (the narrator) aid: They ate to

Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him).  Abu Bakr and Umar 
were also there among the audience.  In the meanwhile the Messenger of Allah 
got up and left us, He delayed in coming back to us, which caused anxiety that 
he might be attacked by some enemy when we were not with him; so being alarmed 
we got up.  I was the first to be alarmed.  I, therefore, went out to look for
 the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) and came to a 
garden belonging to the  Banu an-Najjar, a section of the Ansar went round it 
looking for a gate but failed to find one.  Seeing a rabi' (i.e. streamlet) 
flowing into the garden from a well outside, drew myself together, like a fox, 
and slinked into (the place) where God's Messenger was.  He (the Holy Prophet) 
said: Is it Abu Huraira? I (Abu Huraira) replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah.  He 
(the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter with you? replied: You were amongst 
us but got up and went away and delayed for a time, so fearing that you might be 
attacked by some enemy when we were not with you, we became alarmed.  I was the 
first to be alarmed.  So when I came to this garden, I drew myself together as a 
fox does, and these people are following me. He addressed me as Abu Huraira and 
gave me his sandals and said: Take away these sandals of mine, and when you meet 
anyone outside this garden who testifies that there is no god but Allah, being 
assured of it in his heart, gladden him by announcing that he shall go to Paradise.  
Now the first one I met was Umar.  He asked: What are these sandals, Abu Huraira? I 
replied: These are the sandals of the Messenger of Allah with which he has sent me 
to gladden anyone I meet who testifies that there is no god but Allah, being assured 
of it in his heart, with the announcement that he would go to Paradise.  Thereupon 'Umar 
struck me on the breast and I fell on my back.  He then said: Go back, Abu Huraira, 
So I returned to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and was about to 
break into tears.  'Umar followed me closely and there he was behind me.  The  
Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings be on him) said: What is the matter

message with which you sent me.  He struck me on my breast which made me fall down 
upon my back and ordered me to go back.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace 
be upon him) said: What prompted you to do this, 'Umar?  He said: Messenger of Allah, 
my mother and father be sacrificed to thee, did you send Abu Huraira with your 
sandals to gladden anyone he met and who testified that there is no god but Allah, 
and being assured of it in his heart, with the tidings that he would go to Paradise?  
He said: Yes.  Umar said: Please do it not, for I am afraid that people will trust in 
it alone; let them go on doing (good) deeds.  The Messenger of Allah (may peace be

It is reported on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Prophet of 
Allah (may peace and blessings be upon him) addressed Mu'adh b. Jabal 
as he was riding behind him to which he replied: At thy beck and call, 
and at thy pleasure, Messenger of Allah.  He again called out: Mu'adh, to 
which he (again) replied: At thy beck and call, and at thy pleasure.  He 
(the Holy Prophet) addressed him (again): Mu'adh, to which he replied: At

that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is His bondsman and His

the Satan goes into seclusion and weeps and says: Alas, and in the narration of 
Abu Kuraib the words are: Woe unto me, the son of Adam was commanded to prostrate, 
and he prostrated and Paradise was entitled to him and I was commanded to prostrate, 
but I refused and am doomed to Hell.

observed: He is not one of us (one among the Ummah of Islam) who beat the 
cheeks or tore the front opening of the shirt or uttered the slogans of (the 
days of) Jahiliya (ignorance). Ibn Numair and Abu Bakr said (instead of the word 
"au"(or) it is "wa" [and] the words are) and tore and uttered (the slogans) of 
Jahiliya without "alif".
