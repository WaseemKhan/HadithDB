     Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet made incumbent on every male or female, 
     free man or slave, the payment of one Sa' of dates or barley as 
     Sadaqat-ul-Fitr (or said Sadaqa-Ramadan)." The people then substituted
     half Sa' of wheat for that. Ibn 'Umar used to give dates (as 
     Sadaqat-ulFitr). Once there was scarcity of dates in Medina and Ibn 
     'Umar gave barley. 'And Ibn 'Umar used to give Sadaqat-ul-Fitr for 
     every young and old person. He even used to give on behalf of my 
     children. Ibn 'Umar used to give Sadaqatul-Fitr to those who had been 
     officially appointed for its collection. People used to give 
     Sadaqat-ul-Fitr (even) a day or two before the 'Id.
