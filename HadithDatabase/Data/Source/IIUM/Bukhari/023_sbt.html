     none (in any way) along with Allah, he will enter Paradise." I asked,

<p>

     Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh. He 
     got down from it, entered the Mosque and did not speak with anybody 
     till he came to me and went direct to the Prophet, who was covered 
     with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face. He knelt down and 
     kissed him and then started weeping and said, "My father and my mother
     be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Prophet! Allah will not combine two 
     deaths on you. You have died the death which was written for you." 
<p>

     Narrated Abu Salama from Ibn Abbas :  Abu Bakr came out and 'Umar , 
     was addressing the people, and Abu Bakr told him to sit down but 'Umar
     refused. Abu Bakr again told him to sit down but 'Umar again refused. 
     Then Abu Bakr recited the Tashah-hud (i.e. none has the right to be 
     worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Apostle) and the people 
     attended to Abu Bakr and left 'Umar. Abu Bakr said, "Amma ba'du, 
     whoever amongst you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but 
     whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah 
     said: 'Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed (many) Apostles 
     have passed away before him ..(up to the) grateful.' " (3.144) (The 
     narrator added, "By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that 
     Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then
     whoever heard it, started reciting it ")

     Uhud and we could get nothing except his Burd to shroud him in. And 
     when we covered his head his feet became bare and vice versa. So the 
     Prophet ordered us to cover his head only and to put idhkhir (a kind

     mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)" Ibn Saiyad said, "It is 
     Al-Dukh (the smoke)." (2) The Prophet said, "Let you be in ignominy. 
     You cannot cross your limits." On that 'Umar, said, "O Allah's

     "If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot over-power him, and if he 
     is not, then there is no use of murdering him." (Ibn 'Umar added): 
     Later on Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin
     Ka'b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The
     Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn 
     Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered 
     with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad's 
     mother saw Allah's Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the 
     trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, "O Saf ! (and
     this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad." And with that Ibn 
     Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, "Had this woman left him (Had she not
     disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his
     case.

     crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back 
     and struck him again (and so on). I said, 'Who is this?' They told me 
     to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; 
     with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling 
     underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were
     lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and 
     whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there
     were naked men and women in it. I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to
     proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a 
     man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in
     front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man 
     in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his 
     mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so 
     whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his 
     mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, 'What 
     is this?' They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a 
     well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was 
     sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the 
     tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they 
     (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a
     house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and
     young men, women and children. 
<p>

     Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and 
     made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the 
     first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two 
     companions), 'You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about
     that I have seen.' They said, 'Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw
     being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the 
     people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all 
     over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of 
     Resurrection. 
<p>

     The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had 
     given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to
     sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act
     upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment 
     will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole
     (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal 
     sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were 
     those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the 
     base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were 
     the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was
     Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which 
     you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second 
     house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your
     head.' I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They 
     said, 'That is your place.' I said, 'Let me enter my place.' They 
     said, 'You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and 
     when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then 
     enter your place.' "

     Aisha said, "I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he 
     asked me, 'In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?' She 
     replied, 'In three Sahuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there
     was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked 
     her, 'On which day did the Prophet die?' She replied, 'He died on 
     Monday.' He asked, 'What is today?' She replied, 'Today is Monday.' He
     added, 'I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.'
     Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and
     it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, 'Wash this garment of 
     mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This 
     is worn out.' He said, 'A living person has more right to wear new 
     clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body's pus.' He 
     did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the
     morning."

     Narrated 'Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi:
<p>

     I saw 'Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, "O 'Abdullah 
     bin 'Umar! Go to the mother of the  believers Aisha and say, 'Umar bin
     Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,' and request her to allow me to
     be buried with my companions." (So, Ibn 'Umar conveyed the message to 
     'Aisha.) She said, "I had the idea of having this place for myself but
     today I prefer him ('Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried 
     there)." When 'Abdullah bin 'Umar returned, 'Umar asked him, "What 
     (news) do you have?" He replied, "O chief of the believers! She has 
     allowed you (to be buried there)." On that 'Umar said, "Nothing was 
     more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, 
     when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her ('Aisha ) 
     and say, 'Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives 
     permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to 
     the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more 
     right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h)
     was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people
     after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and 
     obey him," and then he mentioned the name of 'Uthman, 'Ali, Talha, 
     Az-Zubair, 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas. 
<p>

     By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, "O chief of the 
     believers! Be happy with Allah's glad tidings. The grade which you 
     have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you 
     ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all 
     this." 'Umar replied, "O son of my brother! Would that all that 
     privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither 
     lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the 
     early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor 
     and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar 
     who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He 
     should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse 
     their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and 
     regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His 
     Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and 
     not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities."
