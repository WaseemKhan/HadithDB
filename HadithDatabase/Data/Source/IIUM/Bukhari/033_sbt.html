     Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of 
     Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the 
     twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to 
     come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, "Whoever was in Itikaf with 
     me should stay in Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of
     the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. 
     (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the 
     morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in 
     the odd ones of them." It rained that night and the roof of the mosque
     dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my 
     own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet 
     (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).

     Aisha said, "the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days

     morning prayer, he used to enter the tent." Hafsa asked the permission
     of 'Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched 
     her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In 
     the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, 'What is this?" He
     was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, "Do you think 
     that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?" He therefore 
     abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days 
     in the month of Shawwal."

     Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah's

     ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got
     up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they 
     reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two 
     Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah's Apostle . He told 
     them: Do not run away! And said, "She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai."
     Both of them said, "Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O 
     Allah's Apostle!" And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), "Satan
     reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it,

     I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, "Did you hear Allah's Apostle talking 
     about the Night of Qadr?" He replied in the affirmative and said, 
     "Once we were in Itikaf with Allah's Apostle in the middle ten days of
     (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and 
     Allah's Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said,
     'I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but 
     had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten 
     nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and 
     water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had 
     been in Itikaf with Allah's Apostle should return for it.' The people 
     returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in 
     the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the 
     prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah's Apostle
     prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the 
     nose of the Prophet.

     overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the

     place of his Itikaf. 'Aisha asked his permission to let her practice

     When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and 
     when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the 
     morning, Allah's Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four 
     tents and asked, "What is this?" He was informed about it. He then 
     said, "What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, 
     for I do not want to see them." So, the tents were removed. The 
     Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but 
     did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.
