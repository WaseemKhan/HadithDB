     Narrated Rabi bin Hirash:
<p>

     'Uqba bin 'Amr said to Hudhaifa, "Won't you relate to us of what you 
     have heard from Allah's Apostle ?" He said, "I heard him saying, "When
     Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What 
     the people will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn 
     (things). So, if anyone of you comes across this, he should fall in 
     the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in reality, it will be
     fresh cold water." Hudhaifa added, "I also heard him saying, 'From 
     among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the 
     angel of death visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured)
     and he was asked if he had done any good deed.' He replied, 'I don't 
     remember any good deed.' He was asked to think it over. He said, 'I do
     not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the world
     and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among 
     my debtors). So Allah made him enter Paradise." Hudhaifa further said,
     "I also heard him saying, 'Once there was a man on his death-bed, who,
     losing every hope of surviving said to his family: When I die, gather 
     for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When the 
     fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take 
     and crush them into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. 
     the powder) over the sea. They did so, but Allah collected his 
     particles and asked him:
<p>

     Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah forgave him."
     'Uqba bin 'Amr said, "I heard him saying that the Israeli used to dig 
     the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds)."

     On his death-bed Allah's Apostle put a sheet over his-face and when he
     felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of 
     putting and removing the sheet) he said, "May Allah's Curse be on the

     There will be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will

     between the 'Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to 
     the Jews and the Christians is like the example of a person who 
     employed some laborers and asked them, 'Who will work for me till 
     midday for one Qirat each?' The Jews worked for half a day for one 
     Qirat each. The person asked, 'Who will do the work for me from midday
     to the time of the 'Asr (prayer) for one Qirat each?' The Christians 
     worked from midday till the 'Asr prayer for one Qirat. Then the person
     asked, 'Who will do the work for me from the 'Asr till sunset for two 
     Qirats each?' " The Prophet added, "It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are 
     doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double 
     reward. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, 'We have done 
     more work but got less wages.' Allah said, 'Have I been unjust to you 
     as regards your rights?' They said, 'No.' So Allah said, 'Then it is 
     My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. "

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     that he heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Allah willed to test three 
     Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he 
     sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, 'What thing do you 
     like most?' He replied, "Good color and good skin, for the people have
     a strong aversion to me.' The angel touched him and his illness was 
     cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin. The angel 
     asked him, 'What kind of property do you like best?' He replied, 
     'Camels (or cows).' (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or
     the bald-headed man demanded camels and the other demanded cows.) So 
     he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant she-camei, and the angel said
     (to him), 'May Allah bless you in it.'
<p>

     The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, 'What thing do 
     you like most?' He said, 'I like good hair and wish to be cured of 
     this disease, for the people feel repulsion for me.' The angel touched
     him and his illness was cured, and he was given good hair. The angel 
     asked (him), 'What kind of property do you like bests' He replied, 
     'Cows,' The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, 'May Allah bless 
     you in it.' The angel went to the blind man and asked, 'What thing do 
     you like best?' He said, '(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight
     to me so that I may see the people.' The angel touched his eyes and 
     Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him, "What kind of 
     property do you like best?' He replied, 'Sheep.' The angel gave him a 
     pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth 
     to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much that one of 
     the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a 
     herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a 
     valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a 
     leper, went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all 
     means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need 
     except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such 
     nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give
     me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, 'I 
     have many obligations (so I cannot give you).' The angel said, 'I 
     think I know you; were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong
     aversion? Weren't you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all this 
     property).' He replied, '(This is all wrong), I got this property 
     through inheritance from my fore-fathers' The angel said, 'If you are 
     telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before. '
<p>

     Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, 
     went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first 
     one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel 
     said, 'If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were 
     before.'
<p>

     The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind 
     man and said, 'I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of 
     livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to 
     help me except Allah, and after Him, you yourself. I ask you in the 
     Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give me a sheep, 
     so that with its help, I may complete my journey' The man said, 'No 
     doubt, I was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and
     Allah made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By 
     Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my 
     property which you may take for Allah's sake.' The angel replied, 
     'Keep your property with you. You (i.e 3 men) have been tested and 
     Allah is pleased with you and is angry with your two companions."

     Narrated Ibn Umar:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "Once three persons (from the previous nations) 
     were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter 
     in a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside.
     They said to each other, 'O you! Nothing can save you except the 
     truth, so each of you should ask Allah's Help by referring to such a 
     deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining Allah's 
     Pleasure).' So one of them said, 'O Allah! You know that I had a 
     laborer who worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but 
     he departed, leaving it (i.e. his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice 
     and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later on when he came to 
     me asking for his wages, I said (to him), 'Go to those cows and drive 
     them away.' He said to me, 'But you have to pay me only a Faraq of 
     rice,' I said to him, 'Go to those cows and take them, for they are 
     the product of that Faraq (of rice).' So he drove them. O Allah! If 
     you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove the 
     rock.' The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second 
     one said, 'O Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to 
     provide with the milk of my sheep every night. One night I was delayed
     and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and children were 
     crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink 
     unless my parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and 
     also disliked that they should sleep without drinking it, I kept on 
     waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah! If You consider 
     that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.' So the 
     rock shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one 
     said, 'O Allah! You know that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle's
     daughter) who was most beloved to me and I sought to seduce her, but 
     she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold pieces). 
     So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to
     sleep with her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, 'Be afraid 
     of Allah, and do not deflower me but legally. 'I got up and left the 
     hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider that I did that for
     fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they 
     came out (of the cave)." (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask 
     Allah for help directly or through his performed good deeds. But to 
     ask Allah through dead or absent prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, 
     angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it is a kind of 
     disbelief.)

<p>

     We were in the company of the Prophet in a Ghazwa. A large number of 
     emigrants joined him and among the emigrants there was a person who 
     used to play jokes (or play with spears); so he (jokingly) stroked an 
     Ansari man on the hip. The Ans-ari got so angry that both of them 
     called their people. The Ansari said, "Help, O Ansar!" And the 
     emigrant said "Help, O emigrants!" The Prophet came out and said, 
     "What is wrong with the people (as they are calling) this call of the 
     period of Ignorance? "Then he said, "What is the matter with them?" So
     he was told about the stroke of the emigrant to the Ansari. The 
     Prophet said, "Stop this (i.e. appeal for help) for it is an evil

     Narrated Ibn Abbas:
<p>

     When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu Dhar, he said 
     to his brother, "Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man
     (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information 
     from the Heaven. Listen to him and then come to me." His brother set 
     out till he met the Prophet and listened to his speech and returned to
     Abu Dhar and said to him, "I have seen him exhorting people to virtues
     and his speech was not like poetry." Abu Dhar said, "You have not 
     satisfied me as to what I wanted." So, he took his journey-food and a 
     water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he 
     went to the Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and
     he would not like to ask someone about him. So, a portion of the night
     had passed when 'Ali saw him and realized that he was a stranger. Abu 
     Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other 
     about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and
     food and went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed 
     by the Prophet till it was night, when he returned to his sleeping 
     place. 'Ali again passed by him and said, "Hasn't the man (i.e. Abu 
     Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?" So, 'Ali let him get up and 
     took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about 
     anything, till it was the third day when 'Ali had the same experience 
     with him and Abu Dhar again stayed with him. 'Ali then asked, "Won't 
     you tell me what has brought you here?" He replied, "If you give me a 
     promise and a convention that you will guide me, then I will tell 
     you." When 'Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his purpose). 'Ali 
     said, "It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of 
     Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive 
     any danger threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go
     to the watercloset. But if I carried on walking, follow me till you 
     enter the place that I will enter." Abu Dhur agreed and followed 'Ali 
     till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered with 
     him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam 
     on that very spot. The Prophet said to him, "Go back to your people 
     and inform them (of this religion) till you receive my (further) 
     orders." Abu Dhur said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I will 
     proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. 
     infidels)." He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as 
     loudly as possible, "I testify that None has the right to be 
     worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah." The 
     people then got up and beat him till they knocked him down. Al-Abbas 
     came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to you! 
     Don't you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to
     your merchants towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe 
     dwells)?" Thus he saved him from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the 
     next day and the people beat him again and Al-'Abbas drew himself over
     him (to save him as before).

<p>

     Ibn 'Abbas said to us, "Shall I tell you the story of Abu Dhar's 
     conversion to Islam?" We said, "Yes." He said, "Abu Dhar said: I was a
     man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in 
     Mecca, claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, 'Go to that man
     and talk to him and bring me his news.' He set out, met him and 
     returned. I asked him, 'What is the news with you?' He said, 'By 
     Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is 
     evil.' I said to him, 'You have not satisfied me with this little 
     information.' So, I took a waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards
     Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet ), nor did I like to 
     ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and staying in 
     the Mosque. Then 'Ali passed by me and said, 'It seems you are a 
     stranger?' I said, 'Yes.' He proceeded to his house and I accompanied 
     him. Neither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next
     morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the Prophet but no-one told 
     me anything about him. Ali passed by me again and asked, 'Hasn't the 
     man recognized his dwelling place yet' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Come 
     along with me.' He asked me, 'What is your business? What has brought 
     you to this town?' I said to him, 'If you keep my secret, I will tell 
     you.' He said, 'I will do,' I said to him, 'We have heard that a 
     person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother 
     to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory 
     report; so I thought of meeting him personally.' 'Ali said (to Abu 
     Dhar), 'You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so 
     follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see 
     someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending
     to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.' 'Ali 
     proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered
     with him to the Prophet to whom I said, 'Present (the principles of) 
     Islam to me.' When he did, I embraced Islam 'immediately. He said to 
     me, 'O Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your 
     town; and when you hear of our victory, return to us. ' I said, 'By H 
     him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce my conversion to 
     Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),' Abu Dhar went to the
     Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, 'O folk
     of Quraish ! I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except
     Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah's Slave and His 
     Apostle.' (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, 'Get at this Sabi 
     (i.e. Muslim) !' They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al 'Abbas 
     saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and
     said, 'Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, 
     although your trade and your communications are through the territory 
     of Ghifar?' They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to 
     the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They
     again said, 'Get at this Sabi!' I was treated in the same way as on 
     the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found me and threw himself over 
     me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day 
     before.' So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be 
     Merciful to him) to Islam."

     overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get 
     up was Abu Bakr. Allah's Apostles used not to be awakened from his 
     sleep, but he would wake up by himself. 'Umar woke up and then Abu 
     Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet's head and started saying: 
     Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after 
     traveling for a while) he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer.
     A man amongst the people failed to join us in the prayer. When the

     What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?" He replied, "I 
     am Junub," Alllah's Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean
     earth. The man then offered the prayer. Allah's Apostle ordered me and
     a few others to go ahead of him. We had become very thirsty. While we 
     were on our way (looking for water), we came across a lady (riding an 
     animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her, 
     "Where can we get water?" She replied, "Oh ! There is no water." We 
     asked, "how far is your house from the water?" She replied, "A 
     distance of a day and a night travel." We said, "Come on to Allah's

     ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the mouths 
     of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our 
     thirst and we were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and 
     other utensils with water, but we did not water the camels. The 
     waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The Prophet 
     then said, "Bring what (foodstuff) you have." So some dates and pieces
     of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people,
     she said, "I have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the

     (from among them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, 
     should take a fifth or a sixth (or said something similar)." Abu Bakr 
     brought three persons while the Prophet took ten. And Abu Bakr with 
     his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the 
     sub-narrator is in doubt whether 'Abdur-Rahman said, "My wife and my 
     servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr's house.") Abu 
     Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and stayed there till he offered
     the 'Isha' prayers. He returned and stayed till Allah's Apostle took 
     his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his 
     house. His wife said to him, "What has detained you from your guests?"
     He said, "Have you served supper to them?" She said, "They refused to 
     take supper) until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household)
     presented the meal to them but they refused (to eat)" I went to hide 
     myself and he said, "O Ghunthar!" He invoked Allah to cause my ears to
     be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please eat!" and 
     added, I will never eat the meal." By Allah, whenever we took a 
     handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that 
     handful till everybody ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food
     was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr saw that the food was as 
     much or more than the original amount. He called his wife, "O sister 
     of Bani Firas!" She said, "O pleasure of my eyes. The food has been 
     tripled in quantity." Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, 
     "It (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all." He took a 
     handful from it, and carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was
     with the Prophet . There was a treaty between us and some people, and 
     when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US into twelve 
     groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were

     clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that gathered 
     together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) 
     wading through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on
     raining till the next Friday, when the same man or some other man 
     stood up and said, "O Allah's Apostle! The houses have collapsed; 
     please invoke Allah to withhold the rain." On that the Prophet smiled 
     and said, "O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us." I then 
     looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown 
     round Medina.

<p>

     While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and complained to 
     him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came 
     and complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, "Adi! 
     Have you been to Al-Hira?" I said, "I haven't been to it, but I was 
     informed about it." He said, "If you should live for a long time, you 
     will certainly see that a lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will
     (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba, fearing none 
     but Allah." I said to myself, "What will happen to the robbers of the 
     tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?" The 
     Prophet further said. "If you should live long, the treasures of 
     Khosrau will be opened (and taken as spoils)." I asked, "You mean 
     Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?" He said, "Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you 
     should live long, you will see that one will carry a handful of gold 
     or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from him, but 
     will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting 
     Allah, will meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and 
     Allah to interpret for him, and Allah will say to him: 'Didn't I send 
     a messenger to teach you?' He will say: 'Yes.' Allah will say: 'Didn't
     I give you wealth and do you favors?' He will say: 'Yes.' Then he will
     look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and 
     see nothing but Hell."
<p>

     'Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, "Save yourself from the
     (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you 
     do not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word." 'Adi added: 
     (later on) I saw a lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she 
     performed the Tawaf of the Ka'ba, fearing none but Allah. And I was 
     one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau, son of 
     Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet 
     Abu-l-Qasim had said: 'A person will come out with a handful. of 
     gold...etc.

     Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib:
<p>

     Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a saddle from
     him. He said to 'Azib. "Tell your son to carry it with me." So I 
     carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price 
     (of the saddle). My father said, "O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to
     you on your night journey with Allah's Apostle (during Migration)." He
     said, "Yes, we travelled the whole night and also the next day till 
     midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the severe 
     heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and 
     the sunshine had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I 
     levelled a place and covered it with an animal hide or dry grass for 
     the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said, 'Sleep, O Allah's 
     Apostle, and I will guard you.' So he slept and I went out to guard 
     him. Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with
     the same intention we had when we came to it. I asked (him). 'To whom 
     do you belong, O boy?' He replied, 'I belong to a man from Medina or 
     Mecca.' I said, 'Do your sheep have milk?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 
     'Will you milk for us?' He said, 'Yes.' He caught hold of a sheep and 
     I asked him to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The 
     sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara' striking one of his hands with 
     the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the dust.) The 
     shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a 
     leather container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform
     the ablution from. I went to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but 
     when I reached there, the Prophet had already awakened; so I poured 
     water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was 
     cold. Then I said, 'Drink, O Allah's Apostle!' He drank till I was 
     pleased. Then he asked, 'Has the time for our departure come?' I said,
     'Yes.' So we departed after midday. Suraqa bin Malik followed us and I
     said, 'We have been discovered, O Allah's Apostle!' He said, Don't 
     grieve for Allah is with us.' The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. 
     Suraqa) and so the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its 
     belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not sure whether Abu Bakr said, 
     "(It sank) into solid earth.") Suraqa said, 'I see that you have 
     invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will 
     cause those who are seeking after you to return.' The Prophet invoked 
     good on him and he was saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the 
     way, he would say, 'I have looked for him here in vain.' So he caused 
     whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his promise."

     There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and 
     Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. 
     Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: 
     "Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him." Then Allah 
     caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they 
     saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, "This is the 
     act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our 
     companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from 
     them." They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning 
     they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, 
     "This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of 
     our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from 
     them." They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the 
     morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they
     believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and 
     had to leave him thrown (on the ground).

     am Sad." Abu Jahl said, "Are you circumambulating the Ka'ba safely

     (of Mecca)." Sad then said (to Abu Jahl). 'By Allah, if you prevent me
     from performing the Tawaf of the Ka'ba, I will spoil your trade with 
     Sham." Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, "Don't raise your voice." and 
     kept on taking hold of him. Sad became furious and said, (to Umaiya), 
     "Be away from me, for I have heard Muhammad saying that he will kill 
     you." Umaiiya said, "Will he kill me?" Sad said, "Yes,." Umaiya said,

     accompany us for a day or two." He went with them and thus Allah got

<p>

     The Prophet said, "A horse may be kept for one of three purposes: for 
     a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of 
     living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing 
     sins). As for the one for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one
     who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad in Allah's Cause; he ties it
     with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its rope 
     allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its 
     owner). And if it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two 
     hillocks, even its dung will be considered amongst his good deeds. And
     if it passes by a river and drinks water from it, that will be 
     considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no 
     intention of watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps 
     it so that he may earn his living honestly and takes it as a refuge to
     keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining money), and does not 
     forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others 
     to use it for Allah's Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of 
     committing sins for him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and 
     with the intention of harming the Muslims."

     The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied, "Nothing has been 
     revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse (which 
     covers everything) :--'Then whosoever has done good equal to the 
     weight of an atom (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And 
     whosoever has done evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ) 
     ant), Shall see it (Its punishment)." (99.7-8)

     Narrated Anas bin Malik:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle reached Khaibar in the early morning and the people of
     Khaibar came out with their spades, and when they saw the Prophet they
     said, "Muhammad and his army!" and returned hurriedly to take refuge 
     in the fort. The Prophet raised his hands and said, "Allah is Greater!
     Khaibar is ruined ! If we approach a nation, then miserable is the 
     morning of those who are warned."

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I hear many narrations from you but I 
     forget them." He said, "Spread your covering sheet." I spread my sheet
     and he moved both his hands as if scooping something and emptied them 
     in the sheet and said, "Wrap it." I wrapped it round my body, and 
     since then I have never forgotten a single Hadith.
