     Narrated Adi bin Hatim:
<p>

     I asked the Prophet about the game killed by a Mi'rad (i.e. a 
     sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp 
     piece of iron used for hunting). He said, "If the game is killed with 
     its sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a 
     hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful to eat) for it has 
     been beaten to death." I asked him about the game killed by a trained 
     hound. He said, "If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for
     killing the game by the hound, is like its slaughtering. But if you 
     see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it 
     might have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, 
     then you should not eat of it, because you have mentioned Allah's name
     on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned it on some 
     other hound

     let loose my trained hound after a game?" He said, "If you let loose 
     your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Allah, then you
     can eat." I said, "If the hound eats of the game?" He said "Then you

     not for you." I said, "Some times I send my hound and then I find some
     other hound with it?" He said "Don't eat the game, as you have 
     mentioned the Name of Allah on your dog only and not on the other."

     with a dish containing chicken. Among the people there was sitting a

     chicken)." He said, "I have seen it eating something (dirty) and since
     then I have disliked it, and have taken an oath that I shall not eat

     Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group of Al-Ash'ariyin, and met 
     him while he was angry, distributing some camels of Rakat. We asked 
     for mounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, 
     and added, 'I have nothing to mount you on' In the meantime some 
     camels of booty were brought to Allah's Apostle and he asked twice, 
     'Where are Al-Ash'ariyin?" So he gave us five white camels with big 
     humps. We stayed for a short while (after we had covered a little

     and said, "O Allah's Apostle! We asked you for mounts, but you took an
     oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have 
     forgotten your oath.' He said, 'It is Allah Who has given you mounts.
