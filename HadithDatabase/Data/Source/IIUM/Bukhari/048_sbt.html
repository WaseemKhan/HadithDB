     Narrated Urwa bin Al-Musayyab, Alqama bin Waqqas and Ubaidullah bin 
     Abdullah:
<p>

     About the story of 'Aisha and their narrations were similar attesting 
     each other, when the liars said what they invented about 'Aisha, and 
     the Divine Inspiration was delayed, Allah's Apostle sent for 'Ali and 
     Usama to consult them in divorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama said,
     "Keep your wife, as we know nothing about her except good." Buraira 
     said, "I cannot accuse her of any defect except that she is still a 
     young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's dough which the 
     domestic goats come to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive 
     her husband)." Allah's Apostle said, "Who can help me to take revenge 
     over the man who has harmed me by defaming the reputation of my 
     family? By Allah, I have not known about my family-anything except 
     good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a man about whom I did not 
     know anything except good."

<p>

     Allah's Apostle and Ubai bin Kab Al-Ansari went to the garden where 
     Ibn Saiyad used to live. When Allah's Apostle entered (the garden), he
     (i.e. Allah's Apostle ) started hiding himself behind the datepalms as
     he wanted to hear secretly the talk of Ibn Saiyad before the latter 
     saw him. Ibn Saiyad wrapped with a soft decorated sheet was lying on 
     his bed murmuring. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the Prophet hiding behind 
     the stems of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad saying, "O Saf, 
     this is Muhammad." Hearing that Ibn Saiyad stopped murmuring (or got 
     cautious), the Prophet said, "If she had left him undisturbed, he 
     would have revealed his reality." (See Hadith No. 290, Vol 4 for 
     details)

     Narrated Aisha:
<p>

     (the wife of the Prophet)  "Whenever Allah's Apostle intended to go on
     a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with 
     him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew 
     lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him 
     after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in
     a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allah's
     Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we 
     approached the city of Medina, Allah's Apostle ordered us to proceed 
     at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was
     past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned
     (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that 
     my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it 
     and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on 
     the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, 
     thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in 
     weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those 
     people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah 
     while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a
     young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my 
     necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find 
     nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that 
     they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in 
     that state, I felt sleepy and slept.
<p>

     Safwan bin Mu'attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and 
     reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he 
     came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I 
     heard him saying, "Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for 
     Allah, and we will return to Him)." He made his camel knell down. He 
     got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the 
     camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading
     the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take 
     rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into 
     destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the 
     false accusers was 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we 
     returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people 
     were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was 
     feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual 
     kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got 
     sick. But he would come, greet and say, 'How is that (girl)?' I did 
     not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my 
     ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to 
     answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of
     nature except from night to night and that was before we had 
     lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to 
     the habit of the old 'Arabs in the open country (or away from houses).
     So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled 
     because of her long dress and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be 
     ruined.' I said, 'You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man
     who took part in (the battle of) Badr?' She said, 'O Hanata (you 
     there) didn't you hear what they said?' Then she told me the rumors of
     the false accusers. 
<p>

     My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allah's Apostle 
     came to me, and after greeting he said, 'How is that (girl)?' I 
     requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be 
     sure of the news through them I Allah's Apostle allowed me, and I went
     to my parents and asked my mother, 'What are the people talking 
     about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry much about this matter. 
     By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has
     other wives, but the women would forge false news about her.' I said, 
     'Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter?' 
     That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the 
     morning Allah's Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid 
     when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about 
     divorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of 
     the good reputation of his wives and added, 'O Allah's Apostle! Keep 
     you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.' 'Ali bin
     Abu Talib said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions 
     on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the 
     woman-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that Allah's Apostle 
     called Buraira and said, 'O Burair. Did you ever see anything which 
     roused your suspicions about her?' Buraira said, 'No, by Allah Who has
     sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty 
     except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and 
     leaves the dough for the goats to eat.' On that day Allah's Apostle 
     ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in 
     punishing 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah's Apostle said, 'Who 
     will support me to punish that person ('Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) 
     who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I
     know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person 
     about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house 
     except in my company.'
<p>

     Sad bin Mu'adh got up and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! by Allah, I will 
     relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then 
     we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the 
     Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that Sad 
     bin 'Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had 
     been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and 
     said, 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you 
     will never be able to kill him.' On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and
     said (to Sad bin 'Ubada), 'By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will
     kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.' On this 
     the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight 
     each other, while Allah's Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got 
     down and quietened them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On 
     that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, 
     nor could I sleep.
<p>

     In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights 
     and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While 
     they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my 
     permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and 
     started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allah's Apostle 
     came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they 
     forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for
     a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be 
     worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, 'O 
     'Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are 
     innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have 
     committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for 
     when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah 
     accepts his repentance.' When Allah's Apostle finished his speech my 
     tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of 
     it. I requested my father to reply to Allah's Apostle on my behalf. My
     father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Apostle.' 
     I said to my mother, 'Talk to Allah's Apostle on my behalf.' She said,
     'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Apostle.
<p>

     I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I 
     said. 'I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are 
     saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it 
     as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that
     I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you 
     falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would
     believe me. By Allah, I don't compare my situation with you except to 
     the situation of Joseph's father (i.e. Jacob) who said, 'So (for me) 
     patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah
     (Alone) whose help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side of 
     my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never 
     thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I 
     considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Qur'an. I 
     had hoped that Allah's Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would
     prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah's Apostle had not got up and 
     nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to 
     Allah's Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to 
     overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He 
     was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like
     pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah's 
     Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, 'Aisha! 
     Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence.' My mother told me
     to go to Allah's Apostle . I replied, 'By Allah I will not go to him 
     and will not thank but Allah.' So Allah revealed: "Verily! They who 
     spread the slander are a gang among you . . ." (24.11) 
<p>

     When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to
     provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, 'By 
     Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he 
     said about Aisha.' But Allah later revealed: --
<p>

     "And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to 
     help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in 
     Allah's Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that 
     Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most 
     Merciful."  (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, 'Yes ! By Allah! I like 
     that Allah should forgive me,' and resumed helping Mistah whom he used
     to help before. 
<p>

     Allah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophet's wife 
     about me saying, 'What do you know and what did you see?' She replied,
     'O Allah's Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have 
     not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about 
     Aisha." Aisha further added "Zainab was competing with me (in her 
     beauty and the Prophet's love), yet Allah protected her (from being 
     malicious), for she had piety."
