     Narrated Anas bin Malik:
<p>

     A group of three men came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet 
     asking how the Prophet worshipped (Allah), and when they were informed
     about that, they considered their worship insufficient and said, 
     "Where are we from the Prophet as his past and future sins have been 
     forgiven." Then one of them said, "I will offer the prayer throughout 
     the night forever." The other said, "I will fast throughout the year 
     and will not break my fast." The third said, "I will keep away from 
     the women and will not marry forever." Allah's Apostle came to them 
     and said, "Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Allah, I am 
     more submissive to Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast 
     and break my fast, I do sleep and I also marry women. So he who does 
     not follow my tradition in religion, is not from me (not one of my 
     followers)."

<p>

     that he asked 'Aisha about the Statement of Allah:  'If you fear that 
     you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry
     (other) women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear 
     that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, 
     or (the captives) that your right hands possess. That will be nearer 
     to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) 'Aisha said, "O my nephew!
     (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under
     the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and 
     beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr less than what other women
     of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden 
     to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full 
     Mahr, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them."

     jannib-ish-Shaitan ma razaqtana, and if it is destined that they 
     should have a child, then Satan will never be able to harm him."

<p>

     I was ten years old when Allah's Apostle arrived at Medina. My mother 
     and aunts used to urge me to serve the Prophet regularly, and I served
     him for ten years. When the Prophet died I was twenty years old, and I
     knew about the order of Al-Hijab (veiling of ladies) more than any 
     other person when it was revealed. It was revealed for the first time 
     when Allah's Apostle had consummated his marriage with Zainab bint 
     Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he 
     invited the people to a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left 
     except a few who remained with the Prophet for a long time. The 
     Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that those
     people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he 
     came to the threshold of 'Aisha's dwelling place. Then thinking that 
     these people have left by then, he returned and so did I along with 
     him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were still sitting 
     and had not gone. So the Prophet again went away and I went away along
     with him. When we reached the threshold of 'Aisha's dwelling place, he
     thought that they had left, and so he returned and I too, returned 
     along with him and found those people had left. Then the Prophet drew 
     a curtain between me and him, and the Verses of Al-Hijab were 
     revealed.

     Eleven women sat (at a place) and promised and contracted that they 
     would not conceal anything of the news of their husbands. The first 
     one said, "My husband is like the meat of a lean weak camel which is 
     kept on the top of a mountain which is neither easy to climb, nor is 
     the meat fat, so that one might put up with the trouble of fetching 
     it."  The second one said, "I shall not relate my husband's news, for 
     I fear that I may not be able to finish his story, for if I describe 
     him, I will mention all his defects and bad traits." The third one 
     said, "My husband is a tall man; if I describe him (and he hears of 
     that) he will divorce me, and if I keep quiet, he will neither divorce
     me nor treat me as a wife." The fourth one said, "My husband is a 
     moderate person like the night of Tihama which is neither hot nor 
     cold. I am neither afraid of him, nor am I discontented with him." The
     fifth one said, "My husband, when entering (the house) is a leopard, 
     and when going out, is a lion. He does not ask about whatever is in 
     the house."  The sixth one said, "If my husband eats. he eats too much
     (leaving the dishes empty), and if he drinks he leaves nothing, and if
     he sleeps he sleeps alone (away from me) covered in garments and does 
     not stretch his hands here and there so as to know how I fare (get 
     along)." The seventh one said, "My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and
     foolish. All the defects are present in him. He may injure your head 
     or your body or may do both." The eighth one said, "My husband is soft
     to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zarnab (a kind of good 
     smelling grass)." The ninth one said, "My husband is a tall generous 
     man wearing a long strap for carrying his sword.  His ashes are 
     abundant and his house is near to the people who would easily consult 
     him."  The tenth one said, "My husband is Malik, and what is Malik? 
     Malik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond and 
     above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are 
     kept at home (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few 
     are taken to the pastures. When the camels hear the sound of the lute 
     (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going to be slaughtered
     for the guests." The eleventh one said, "My husband is Abu Zar and 
     what is Abu Zar (i.e., what should I say about him)? He has given me 
     many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms 
     have become fat (i.e., I have become fat). And he has pleased me, and 
     I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He found me with 
     my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and 
     brought me to a respected family having horses and camels and 
     threshing and purifying grain . Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or 
     insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the morning, and when I 
     drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what
     may one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were 
     always full of provision and her house was spacious.  As for the son 
     of Abu Zar, what may one say of the son of Abu Zar? His bed is as 
     narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four months) 
     satisfies his hunger.  As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient
     to her father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and 
     that arouses the jealousy of her husband's other wife. As for the 
     (maid) slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the (maid) slavegirl
     of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does 
     not waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered 
     everywhere in our house." The eleventh lady added, "One day it so 
     happened that Abu Zar went out at the time when the milk was being 
     milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had two sons like two 
     leopards playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me 
     and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a 
     fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many 
     things, and also a pair of every kind of livestock and said, 'Eat (of 
     this), O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives." She added, 
     "Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill 
     the smallest utensil of Abu Zar's." 'Aisha then said: Allah's Apostle 
     said to me, "I am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar."

     Narrated Ibn 'Abbas :
<p>

     I had been eager to ask 'Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two ladies from
     among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said 'If you two 
     (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to 
     Allah, your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet 
     likes). (66.4) till 'Umar performed the Hajj and I too, performed the 
     Hajj along with him. (On the way) 'Umar went aside to answer the call 
     of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler 
     full of water, and when 'Umar had finished answering the call of 
     nature, I poured water over his hands and he performed the ablution. 
     Then I said to him, "O chief of the Believers! Who were the two ladies
     from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: 'If you
     two (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are
     indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes)?" (66.4) He 
     said, "I am astonished at your question, O Ibn Abbas. They were 'Aisha
     and Hafsa." Then 'Umar went on narrating the Hadith and said, "I and 
     an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who used to live
     in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go 
     one day and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of 
     what had happened that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other 
     things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the 
     people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when
     we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand 
     over their men, so our women also started learning the ways of the 
     Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I 
     disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, 'Why are you 
     so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the 
     Prophet answer him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to)
     him throughout the day till the night.' The (talk) scared me and I 
     said to her, 'Whoever has done so will be ruined!' Then I proceeded 
     after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, 'Does 
     anyone of you keep the Prophet angry till night?' She said, 'Yes.' I 
     said, 'You are a ruined losing person! Don't you fear that Allah may 
     get angry for the anger of Allah's Apostle and thus you will be 
     ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back
     and do not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not
     be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e., 'Aisha) in her manners for 
     she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet ." Umar 
     added,"At that time a talk was circulating among us that (the tribe 
     of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari 
     companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to 
     us at night and knocked at my door violently and asked if I was there.
     I became horrified and came out to him. He said, 'Today a great thing 
     has happened.' I asked, 'What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan 
     come?' He said, 'No, but (What has happened) is greater and more 
     horrifying than that: Allah's Apostle; has divorced his wives. 'Umar 
     added, "The Prophet kept away from his wives and I said "Hafsa is a 
     ruined loser.' I had already thought that most probably this (divorce)
     would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the 
     morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper
     room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her 
     weeping. I asked, 'What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that?
     Did the Prophet divorce you all?' She said, 'I do not know. There he 
     is retired alone in the upper room.' I came out and sat near the 
     pulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them 
     were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not endure the 
     situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said
     to a black slave of his, 'Will you get the permission (of the Prophet 
     ) for 'Umar (to enter)?' The slave went in, talked to the Prophet 
     about it and then returned saying, 'I have spoken to the Prophet and 
     mentioned you but he kept quiet.' Then I returned and sat with the 
     group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear the 
     situation and once again I said to the slave, 'Will you get the 
     permission for 'Umar?' He went in and returned saying, 'I mentioned 
     you to him but he kept quiet.' So I returned again and sat with the 
     group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the 
     situation, and so I went to the slave and said, 'Will you get the 
     permission for 'Umar?' He went in and returned to me saying, 'I 
     mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' When I was leaving, behold! 
     The slave called me, saying, 'The Prophet has given you permission.' 
     Then I entered upon Allah's Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of
     stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding between it and 
     him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on a leather
     pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while still 
     standing I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?' He
     looked at me and said, 'No.' I said, 'Allah Akbar!' And then, while 
     still standing, I said chatting, 'Will you heed what I say, O Allah's 
     Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power over our women, 
     but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were 
     overpowered by their women.' The Prophet smiled and then I said to 
     him, 'Will you heed what I say, O Allah's Apostle? I entered upon 
     Hafsa and said to her, "Do not be tempted to imitate your companion 
     ('Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the 
     Prophet.' " The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him 
     smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I 
     could not see anything of importance in his house except three hides, 
     so I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make your followers 
     rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made prosperous and 
     they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do 
     not worship Allah.' Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. 
     and said, 'Are you of such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These 
     are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in 
     this world.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Ask Allah to forgive me.' 
     Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because
     of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to 'Aisha. The Prophet had 
     said, 'I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,' because 
     of his anger towards them, when Allah had admonished him.  So, when 
     twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon 'Aisha. 
     'Aisha said to him, 'O Allah's Apostle! You had sworn that you would 
     not enter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have 
     passed, for I have been counting them one by one.' The Prophet said, 
     'The (present) month is of twenty nine days.' 'Aisha added, 'Then 
     Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives 
     he asked me first, and I chose him.' Then he gave option to his other 
     wives and they said what 'Aisha had said . " (1) The Prophet, ' had 
     decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a 
     certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of his wives 
     were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them
     for one month. See Quran: (66.4)

     During the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, the sun eclipsed. Allah's

     along with him. He performed a long Qiyam (standing posture) during 
     which Surat-al-Baqara could have been recited; then he performed a 
     pro-longed bowing, then raised his head and stood for a long time 
     which was slightly less than that of the first Qiyam (and recited 
     Qur'an). Then he performed a prolonged bowing again but the period was
     shorter than the period of the first bowing, then he stood up and then
     prostrated. Again he stood up, but this time the period of standing 
     was less than the first standing. Then he performed a prolonged bowing
     but of a lesser duration than the first, then he stood up again for a 
     long time but for a lesser duration than the first. Then he performed 
     a prolonged bowing but of lesser duration than the first, and then he 
     again stood up, and then prostrated and then finished his prayer. By 
     then the sun eclipse had cleared. The Prophet then said, "The sun and 
     the moon are two signs among the signs of Allah, and they do not 
     eclipse because of the death or birth of someone, so when you observe 
     the eclipse, remember Allah (offer the eclipse prayer)." They (the 
     people) said, "O Allah's Apostle! We saw you stretching your hand to 
     take something at this place of yours, then we saw you stepping 
     backward." He said, "I saw Paradise (or Paradise was shown to me), and
     I stretched my hand to pluck a bunch (of grapes), and had I plucked 
     it, you would have eaten of it as long as this world exists. Then I

<p>

     While we were sitting with Allah's Apostle, (he) Allah's Apostle said,
     "While I was sleeping, I saw a woman performing ablution beside a 
     palace. I asked, "Whose palace is this?' It was said, 'This palace 
     belongs to 'Umar.' Then I remembered his sense of Ghira and returned."
     On that 'Umar started weeping in that gathering and said, "O Allah's 
     Apostle! How dare I think of my self-respect being offended by you?"
