     Narrated Az-Zuhri:
<p>

     Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the 
     Quranic Verse:--
<p>

     "And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls 
     then marry (other) women of your choice." (4.2-3)
<p>

     Aisha said, "It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her
     guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth,
     and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of
     her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the 
     orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they
     were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people
     asked Allah's Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following 
     Verse:--
<p>

     "They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah 
     instructs you regarding them..." (4.127)
<p>

     and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was 
     beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her
     without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could 
     get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he 
     would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of 
     her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards
     her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her,
     unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing 
     all her rights.

     trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, but

     Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
<p>

     When 'Umar got a piece of land in Khaibar, he came to the Prophet 
     saying, "I have got a piece of land, better than which I have never 
     got. So what do you advise me regarding it?" The Prophet said, "If you
     wish you can keep it as an endowment to be used for charitable 
     purposes." So, 'Umar gave the land in charity (i.e. as an endowments 
     on the condition that the land would neither be sold nor given as a 
     present, nor bequeathed, (and its yield) would be used for the poor, 
     the kinsmen, the emancipation of slaves, Jihad, and for guests and 
     travelers; and its administrator could eat in a reasonable just 
     manner, and he also could feed his friends without intending to be 
     wealthy by its means."

     Once 'Umar gave a horse in charity to be used in holy fighting. It had
     been given to him by Allah's Apostle . 'Umar gave it to another man to
     ride. Then 'Umar was informed that the man put the horse for sale, so

     replied, "You should not buy it, for you should not take back what you

     Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari:
<p>

     My father was martyred on the day (of the Ghazwa) of Uhud and left six
     daughters and some debts to be paid. When the time of plucking the 
     date-fruits came, I went to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's 
     Apostle! you know that my father was martyred on Uhud's day and owed 
     much debt, and I wish that the creditors would see you." The Prophet 
     said, "Go and collect the various kinds of dates and place them 
     separately in heaps"' I did accordingly and called him. On seeing him,
     the creditors started claiming their rights pressingly at that time. 
     When the Prophet saw how they behaved, he went round the biggest heap 
     for three times and sat over it and said, "Call your companions (i.e. 
     the creditors)." Then he kept on measuring and giving them, till Allah
     cleared all my father's debts. By Allah, it would have pleased me that
     Allah would clear the debts of my father even though I had not taken a
     single date to my sisters. But by Allah, all the heaps were complete, 
     (as they were) and I looked at the heap where Allah's Apostle was 
     sitting and noticed as if not a single date had been taken thereof.
