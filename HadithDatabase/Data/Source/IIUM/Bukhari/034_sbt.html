     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from Allah's 
     Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate
     from Allah's Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were 
     busy in the market while I used to stick to Allah's Apostle content 
     with what fills my stomach; so I used to be present when they were 
     absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my Ansari 
     brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the 
     poor men of Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to
     forget. No doubt, Allah's Apostle once said, "Whoever spreads his 
     garment till I have finished my present speech and then gathers it to 
     himself, will remember whatever I will say." So, I spread my colored 
     garment which I was wearing till Allah's Apostle had finished his 
     saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any 
     of that narrations.

     Narrated Ibrahim bin Sad from his father from his grand-father:
<p>

     Abdur Rahman bin Auf said, "When we came to Medina as emigrants, 
     Allah's Apostle established a bond of brotherhood between me and Sad 
     bin Ar-Rabi'. Sad bin Ar-Rabi' said (to me), 'I am the richest among 
     the Ansar, so I will give you half of my wealth and you may look at my
     two wives and whichever of the two you may choose I will divorce her, 
     and when she has completed the prescribed period (before marriage) you
     may marry her.' Abdur-Rahman replied, "I am not in need of all that. 
     Is there any market-place where trade is practiced?' He replied, "The 
     market of Qainuqa." Abdur-Rahman went to that market the following day
     and brought some dried butter-milk (yogurt) and butter, and then he 
     continued going there regularly. Few days later, 'AbdurRahman came 
     having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Allah's Apostle asked him
     whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet
     said, 'Whom have you married?' He replied, 'A woman from the Ansar.' 
     Then the Prophet asked, 'How much did you pay her?' He replied, '(I 
     gave her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a date stone (or a date stone
     of gold)! The Prophet said, 'Give a Walima (wedding banquet) even if 
     with one sheep .' "

     a rich man, so he said to 'Abdur-Rahman, "I will give you half of my

     Allah bless you in your family and property. Show me the market." So 
     'Abdur-Rahman did not return from the market) till he gained some 
     dried buttermilk (yoghurt) and butter (through trading). He brought 
     that to his house-hold. We stayed for some-time (or as long as Allah 
     wished), and then Abdur-Rahman came, scented with yellowish perfume. 
     The Prophet said (to him) "What is this?" He replied, "I got married

     Prophet told his wife Sauda bint Zam'a to screen herself from that boy

     some of the qualities attributed to him in the Quran as follows:
<p>

     "O Prophet ! We have sent you as a witness (for Allah's True religion)
     And a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), And a warner 
     (to the unbelievers) And guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave
     and My messenger (i.e. Apostle). I have named you "Al-Mutawakkil" (who
     depends upon Allah). You are neither discourteous, harsh Nor a 
     noise-maker in the markets And you do not do evil to those Who do evil
     to you, but you deal With them with forgiveness and kindness. Allah 
     will not let him (the Prophet) Die till he makes straight the crooked 
     people by making them say: "None has the right to be worshipped but 
     Allah," With which will be opened blind eyes And deaf ears and 
     enveloped hearts."

     Aisha, (mother of the faithful believers) wanted to buy a slave girl 
     and manumit her, but her masters said that they would sell her only on
     the condition that her Wala' would be for them. 'Aisha told Allah's 
     Apostle of that. He said, "What they stipulate should not hinder you 
     from buying her, as the Wala' is for the manumitted."

     over and blocked the mouth of the cave. They said to each other, 
     'Invoke Allah with the best deed you have performed (so Allah might 
     remove the rock)'. One of them said, 'O Allah! My parents were old and
     I used to go out for grazing (my animals). On my return I would milk 
     (the animals) and take the milk in a vessel to my parents to drink. 
     After they had drunk from it, I would give it to my children, family 
     and wife. One day I was delayed and on my return I found my parents 
     sleeping, and I disliked to wake them up. The children were crying at 
     my feet (because of hunger). That state of affairs continued till it 
     was dawn. O Allah! If You regard that I did it for Your sake, then 
     please remove this rock so that we may see the sky.' So, the rock was 
     moved a bit. The second said, 'O Allah! You know that I was in love 
     with a cousin of mine, like the deepest love a man may have for a 
     woman, and she told me that I would not get my desire fulfilled unless
     I paid her one-hundred Dinars (gold pieces). So, I struggled for it 
     till I gathered the desired amount, and when I sat in between her 
     legs, she told me to be afraid of Allah, and asked me not to deflower 
     her except rightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O 
     Allah! If You regard that I did if for Your sake, kindly remove this 
     rock.' So, two-thirds of the rock was removed. Then the third man 
     said, 'O Allah! No doubt You know that once I employed a worker for 
     one Faraq (three Sa's) of millet, and when I wanted to pay him, he 
     refused to take it, so I sowed it and from its yield I bought cows and
     a shepherd. After a time that man came and demanded his money. I said 
     to him: Go to those cows and the shepherd and take them for they are 
     for you. He asked me whether I was joking with him. I told him that I 
     was not joking with him, and all that belonged to him. O Allah! If You
     regard that I did it sincerely for Your sake, then please remove the 
     rock.' So, the rock was removed completely from the mouth of the 
     cave."

     We were with the Prophet when a tall pagan with long matted unkempt

     for sale or for gifts?" The pagan replied, "They are for sale." The

<p>

     The Prophet said, "The Prophet Abraham emigrated with Sarah and 
     entered a village where there was a king or a tyrant. (The king) was 
     told that Abraham had entered (the village) accompanied by a woman who
     was one of the most charming women. So, the king sent for Abraham and 
     asked, 'O Abraham! Who is this lady accompanying you?' Abraham 
     replied, 'She is my sister (i.e. in religion).' Then Abraham returned 
     to her and said, 'Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed 
     them that you are my sister. By Allah, there are no true believers on 
     this land except you and 1.' Then Abraham sent her to the king. When 
     the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, prayed and 
     said, 'O Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle, and have 
     saved my private parts from everybody except my husband, then please 
     do not let this pagan overpower me.' On that the king fell in a mood 
     of agitation and started moving his legs. Seeing the condition of the 
     king, Sarah said, 'O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that
     I have killed him.' The king regained his power, and proceeded towards
     her but she got up again and performed ablution, prayed and said, 'O 
     Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle and have kept my 
     private parts safe from all except my husband, then please do not let 
     this pagan overpower me.' The king again fell in a mood of agitation 
     and started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sarah 
     said, 'O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that I have 
     killed him.' The king got either two or three attacks, and after 
     recovering from the last attack he said, 'By Allah! You have sent a 
     satan to me. Take her to Abraham and give her Ajar.' So she came back 
     to Abraham and said, 'Allah humiliated the pagan and gave us a 
     slavegirl for service."
