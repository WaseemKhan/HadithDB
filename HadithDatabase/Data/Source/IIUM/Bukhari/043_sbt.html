     Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "When the believers pass safely over (the bridge
     across) Hell, they will be stopped at a bridge in between Hell and 
     Paradise where they will retaliate upon each other for the injustices 
     done among them in the world, and when they get purified of all their 
     sins, they will be admitted into Paradise. By Him in Whose Hands the 
     life of Muhammad is everybody will recognize his dwelling in Paradise 
     better than he recognizes his dwelling in this world."

     Narrated Safwan bin Muhriz Almazini:
<p>

     While I was walking with Ibn 'Umar holding his hand, a man came in 
     front of us and asked, "What have you heard from Allah's Apostle about
     An-Najwa?" Ibn 'Umar said, "I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'Allah 
     will bring a believer near Him and shelter him with His Screen and ask
     him: Did you commit such-and-such sins? He will say: Yes, my Lord. 
     Allah will keep on asking him till he will confess all his sins and 
     will think that he is ruined. Allah will say: 'I did screen your sins 
     in the world and I forgive them for you today', and then he will be 
     given the book of his good deeds. Regarding infidels and hypocrites 
     (their evil acts will be exposed publicly) and the witnesses will say:
     These are the people who lied against their Lord. Behold! The Curse of
     Allah is upon the wrongdoers." (11.18)

<p>

     Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:
<p>

     I had been eager to ask 'Umar about the two ladies from among the 
     wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur'an saying):
     If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in 
     repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what
     the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with 'Umar 
     (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of 
     nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of 
     water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured 
     water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said,
     "O Chief of the believers! ' Who were the two ladies from among the 
     wives of the Prophet to whom Allah said: 
<p>

     'If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, "I am astonished at 
     your question, O Ibn 'Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa." 
<p>

     Then 'Umar went on relating the narration and said. "I and an Ansari 
     neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in 'Awali 
     Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, 
     and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had 
     happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he 
     went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used 
     to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar,
     we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so
     our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I 
     shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that
     she should answer me back. She said, 'Why do you take it ill that I 
     retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, 
     and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.'
     What she said scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever amongst them does 
     so, will be a great loser.' Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa 
     and asked her, 'Does any of you keep Allah's Apostle angry all the day
     long till night?' She replied in the affirmative. I said, 'She is a 
     ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn't she fear 
     that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah's Apostle and thus she
     will be ruined? Don't ask Allah's Apostle too many things, and don't 
     retort upon him in any case, and don't desert him. Demand from me 
     whatever you like, and don't be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e.
     'Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is 
     more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah's Apostle.
<p>

     In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) 
     was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to 
     the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night 
     and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was
     scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a 
     great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? 
     He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added 
     that Allah's Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a 
     ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.' So I dressed 
     myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet 
     entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and 
     found her weeping. I asked her, 'Why are you weeping? Didn't I warn 
     you? Have Allah's Apostle divorced you all?' She replied, 'I don't 
     know. He is there in the upper room.' I then went out and came to the 
     pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were 
     weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the 
     situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and 
     requested to a black slave of his: "Will you get the permission of 
     (Allah's Apostle) for Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to 
     the Prophet about it and came out saying, 'I mentioned you to him but 
     he did not reply.' So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting
     by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to  the 
     slave again and said: "Will you get  he permission for Umar? He went 
     in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, 
     the slave called me saying, "Allah's Apostle has granted you 
     permission." So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat
     without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of 
     the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm 
     fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: "Have you 
     divorced your wives?' He raised his eyes to me and replied in the 
     negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: "Will you 
     heed what I say, 'O Allah's Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to
     have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the 
     people whose women had the upper hand over them..." 
<p>

     'Umar told the whole story (about his wife). "On that the Prophet 
     smiled." 'Umar further said, "I then said, 'I went to Hafsa and said 
     to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion ('Aisha) for she 
     is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' The 
     Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a 
     glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn't see anything of 
     importance but three hides. I said (to Allah's Apostle) "Invoke Allah 
     to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines 
     have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do 
     not worship Allah?' The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my 
     speech he sat straight) and said, 'O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any 
     doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people 
     have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.' I 
     asked the Prophet . 'Please ask Allah's forgiveness for me. The 
     Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had 
     disclosed to 'Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for
     one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his
     oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had 
     passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, 'You 
     took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today 
     only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by
     day.' The Prophet said, 'The month is also of twenty-nine days.' That 
     month consisted of twenty-nine days. 'Aisha said, 'When the Divine 
     revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying
     to me, 'I am telling you something, but you needn't hurry to give the 
     reply till you can consult your parents." 'Aisha knew that her parents
     would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that 
     Allah had said:--
<p>

     'O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world 
     And its glitter, ... then come! I will make a provision for you and 
     set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And His 
     Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has 
     prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.'   (33.28) 
     'Aisha said, 'Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer 
     Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.' After that the 
     Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same
     reply as 'Aisha did."

     herself (for an evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd 
     and allowed him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and 
     later she gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from

     him out of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the 
     prayer, then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; "O boy! Who is

     people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but 
     Juraij asked them to make it of mud only."
