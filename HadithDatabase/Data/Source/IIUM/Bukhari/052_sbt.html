     Narrated Abdullah bin Masud:
<p>

     I asked Allah's Apostle, "O Allah's Apostle! What is the best deed?" 
     He replied, "To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times." 
     I asked, "What is next in goodness?" He replied, "To be good and 
     dutiful to your parents." I further asked, what is next in goodness?" 
     He replied, "To participate in Jihad in Allah's Cause." I did not ask 
     Allah's Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have 
     told me more.

     Narrated Anas bin Malik:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle used to visit Um Haran bint Milhan, who would offer 
     him reals. Um-Haram was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit. Allah's 
     Apostle, once visited her and she provided him with food and started 
     looking for lice in his head. Then Allah's Apostle slept, and 
     afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haran asked, "What causes you to smile,
     O Allah's Apostle?" He said. "Some of my followers who (in a dream) 
     were presented before me as fighters in Allah's Cause (on board a 
     ship) amidst this sea cause me to smile; they were as kings on the 
     thrones (or like kings on the thrones)." (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not
     sure as to which expression the Prophet used.) Um-Haram said, "O 
     Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah that he makes me one of them. Allah's 
     Apostle invoked Allah for her and slept again and woke up smiling. 
     Once again Um Haram asked, "What makes you smile, O Allah's Apostle?" 
     He replied, "Some of my followers were presented to me as fighters in 
     Allah's Cause," repeating the same dream. Um-Haram said, "O Allah's 
     Apostle! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of them." He said, "You are
     amongst the first ones." It happened that she sailed on the sea during
     the Caliphate of Mu'awlya bin Abi Sufyan, and after she disembarked, 
     she fell down from her riding animal and died.

     granted Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he fights in Allah's 
     Cause or remains in the land where he is born." The people said, "O 
     Allah's Apostle ! Shall we acquaint the people with the is good news?"
     He said, "Paradise has one-hundred grades which Allah has reserved for
     the Mujahidin who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each of
     two grades is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, 
     when you ask Allah (for something), ask for Al-firdaus which is the 
     best and highest part of Paradise." (i.e. The sub-narrator added, "I

     My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the Battle of Badr. He said,
     "O Allah's Apostle! I was absent from the first battle you fought 
     against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the
     pagans, no doubt. Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight." On the 
     day of Uhud when the Muslims turned their backs and fled, he said, "O 
     Allah! I apologize to You for what these (i.e. his companions) have 
     done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have done." Then he 
     advanced and Sad bin Muadh met him. He said "O Sad bin Muadh ! By the 
     Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before 
     (the mountain of) Uhud," Later on Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! I 
     cannot achieve or do what he (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found 
     more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him
     dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister 
     could recognize him by his fingers." We used to think that the 
     following Verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort:
     "Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with
     Allah.........." (33.23)

     His sister Ar-Rubbaya' broke a front tooth of a woman and Allah's

     Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, my sister's 
     tooth shall not be broken." Then the opponents of Anas's sister 
     accepted the compensation and gave up the claim of retaliation. So 
     Allah's Apostle said, "There are some people amongst Allah's slaves

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, " Horses are kept for one of three purposes; for
     some people they are a source of reward, for some others they are a 
     means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins. The 
     one for whom they are a source of reward, is he who keeps a horse for 
     Allah's Cause (i.e. Jihad) tying it with a long tether on a meadow or 
     in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area of the
     meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds 
     for his benefit, and if it should break its rope and jump over one or 
     two hillocks then all its dung and its foot marks will be written as 
     good deeds for him; and if it passes by a river and drinks water from 
     it even though he had no intention of watering it, even then he will 
     get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom horses are a 
     source of sins, he is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride 
     and pretense and showing enmity for Muslims: such a horse will be a 
     source of sins for him. When Allah's Apostle was asked about donkeys, 
     he replied, "Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this 
     unique, comprehensive Verse: "Then anyone who does an atom's (or a 
     small ant's) weight of good shall see it; And anyone who does an 
     atom's (or a small ant's) weight of evil, shall see it.' (101.7-8)

     him on one of the journeys." (Abu Aqil said, "I do not know whether

     returning," Jabir continued, "the Prophet said, 'Whoever wants to 
     return earlier to his family, should hurry up.' We set off and I was 
     on a black red tainted camel having no defect, and the people were 
     behind me. While I was in that state the camel stopped suddenly 
     (because of exhaustion). On that the Prophet said to me, 'O Jabir, 
     wait!' Then he hit it once with his lash and it started moving on a 
     fast pace. He then said, 'Will you sell the camel?' I replied in the 
     affirmative when we reached Medina, and the Prophet went to the Mosque
     along with his companions. I, too, went to him after tying the camel 
     on the pavement at the Mosque gate. Then I said to him, 'This is your 
     camel.' He came out and started examining the camel and saying, 'The 
     camel is ours.' Then the Prophet sent some Awaq (i.e. an amount) of 
     gold saying, 'Give it to Jabir.' Then he asked, 'Have you taken the 
     full price (of the camel)?' I replied in the affirmative. He said, 
     'Both the price and the camel are for you.' ''

     Um Haram told me that the Prophet one day took a midday nap in her 
     house. Then he woke up smiling. Um Haram asked, "O Allah's Apostle! 
     What makes you smile?" He replied "I was astonished to see (in my 
     dream) some people amongst my followers on a sea-voyage looking like 
     kings on the thrones." She said, "O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to 
     make me one of them." He replied, "You are amongst them." He slept 
     again and then woke up smiling and said the same as before twice or 
     thrice. And she said, "O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one 
     of them." And he said, "You are amongst the first batch." 'Ubada bin 
     As-Samit married her (i.e. Um Haram) and then he took her for Jihad. 
     When she returned, an animal was presented to her to ride, but she 
     fell down and her neck was broken.

     Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa'idi:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle and the pagans faced each other and started fighting. 
     When Allah's Apostle returned to his camp and when the pagans returned
     to their camp, somebody talked about a man amongst the companions of 
     Allah's Apostle who would follow and kill with his sword any pagan 
     going alone. He said, "Nobody did his job (i.e. fighting) so properly 
     today as that man." Allah's Apostle said, "Indeed, he is amongst the 
     people of the (Hell) Fire." A man amongst the people said, "I shall 
     accompany him (to watch what he does)" Thus he accompanied him, and 
     wherever he stood, he would stand with him, and wherever he ran, he 
     would run with him.
<p>

     Then the (brave) man got wounded seriously and he decided to bring 
     about his death quickly. He planted the blade of the sword in the 
     ground directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two 
     breasts. Then he leaned on the sword and killed himself. The other man
     came to Allah's Apostle and said, "I testify that you are Allah's 
     Apostle." The Prophet asked, "What has happened?" He replied, "(It is 
     about) the man whom you had described as one of the people of the 
     (Hell) Fire. The people were greatly surprised at what you said, and I
     said, 'I will find out his reality for you.' So, I came out seeking 
     him. He got severely wounded, and hastened to die by slanting the 
     blade of his sword in the ground directing its sharp end towards his 
     chest between his two breasts. Then he eased on his sword and killed 
     himself." when Allah's Apostle said, "A man may seem to the people as 
     if he were practising the deeds of the people of Paradise while in 
     fact he is from the people of the Hell) Fire, another may seem to the 
     people as if he were practicing the deeds of the people of Hell

     not flee, but his young unarmed companions passed by the archers of 
     the tribe of Hawazin and Bani Nasr whose arrows hardly missed a 
     target, and they threw arrows at them hardly missing a shot. So the 
     Muslims retreated towards the Prophet while he was riding his white 
     mule which was being led by his cousin Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin 
     'Abdul Muttalib. The Prophet dismounted and invoked Allah for victory;
     then he said, 'I am the Prophet, without a lie; I am the son of 'Abdul
     Muttalib, and then he arranged his companions in rows."

     Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle wrote to Caesar and invited him to Islam and sent him 
     his letter with Dihya Al-Kalbi whom Allah's Apostle ordered to hand it
     over to the Governor of Busra who would forward it to Caesar. Caesar 
     as a sign of gratitude to Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. 
     Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory over the Persian forces.
     So, when the letter of Allah's Apostle reached Caesar, he said after 
     reading t, 'Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish 
     tribe) if present here, in order to ask him about Allah's Apostle. At 
     that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in Sham with some men frown Quraish 
     who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that had been 
     concluded between Allah's Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu 
     Sufyan said, Caesar's messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took 
     me and my companions to Ilya and we were admitted into Ceasar's court 
     to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a crown and surrounded 
     by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his translator.
     'Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims 
     to be a prophet." Abu Sufyan added, "I replied, 'I am the nearest 
     relative to him.' He asked, 'What degree of relationship do you have 
     with him?' I replied, 'He is my cousin,' and there was none of Bani 
     Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, 'Let him come 
     nearer.' He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my 
     shoulder and said to his translator, 'Tell his companions that I am 
     going to ask this man about the man who claims to be a prophet. If he 
     tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately." Abu Sufyan 
     added, "By Allah ! Had it not been shameful that my companions label 
     me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked 
     me. But I considered it shameful to be called a liar by my companions.
     So I told the truth. He then said to his translator, 'Ask him what 
     kind of family does he belong to.' I replied, 'He belongs to a noble 
     family amongst us.' He said, 'Have anybody else amongst you ever 
     claimed the same before him? 'I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Had you ever 
     blamed him for telling lies before he claimed what he claimed? ' I 
     replied, 'No.' He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?' I 
     replied, 'No.' He said, "Do the noble or the poor follow him?' I 
     replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.' He said, 'Are they 
     increasing or decreasing (day by day)?' I replied,' They are 
     increasing.' He said, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his (the
     Prophet's) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?'.
     I replied, 'No. ' He said, 'Does he break his promises? I replied, 
     'No, but we are now at truce with him and we are afraid that he may 
     betray us." Abu Sufyan added, "Other than the last sentence, I could 
     not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, 'Have you ever had a 
     war with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'What was the outcome of 
     your battles with him?' I replied, 'The result was unstable; sometimes
     he was victorious and sometimes we.' He said, 'What does he order you 
     to do?' I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah alone, and not to 
     worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers 
     used to worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, 
     keep promises and return what is entrusted to us.' When I had said 
     that, Caesar said to his translator, 'Say to him: I ask you about his 
     lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In 
     fact, all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations.
     Then I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you had claimed 
     such a thing, and your reply was in the negative. If the answer had 
     been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was 
     following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you 
     whether he was ever blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the 
     negative, so I took it for granted that a person who did not tell a 
     lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about Allah. Then
     I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in
     the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have 
     thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. When 
     I asked you whether the rich or the poor people followed him, you 
     replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the 
     followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were
     increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In 
     fact, this is the result of true faith till it is complete (in all 
     respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing 
     his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply
     was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when
     its cheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody 
     will be displeased with it. I asked you whether he had ever broken his
     promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they 
     never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with 
     him and he fought with you, you replied that he did, and that 
     sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the 
     apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always 
     theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he 
     ordered you to worship Allah alone and not to worship others along 
     with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to 
     offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and
     to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of 
     a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but
     I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say 
     should be true, he will very soon occupy the earth under my feet, and 
     if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go immediately to
     meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.' 
     " Abu Sufyan added, "Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah's 
     Apostle and it was read. Its contents were:--
<p>

     "In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful (This 
     letter is) from Muhammad, the slave of Allah, and His Apostle, to 
     Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the followers of
     guidance. Now then, I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), 
     embrace Islam and you will be safe; embrace Islam and Allah will 
     bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this invitation of 
     Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your
     nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common to you and 
     us and you, that we worship. None but Allah, and that we associate 
     nothing in worship with Him; and that none of us shall take others as 
     Lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we
     are (they who have surrendered (unto Him)..(3.64)
<p>

     Abu Sufyan added, "When Heraclius had finished his speech, there was a
     great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine Royalties surrounding him, 
     and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said. 
     So, we were turned out of the court. When I went out with my 
     companions and we were alone, I said to them, 'Verily, Ibn Abi 
     Kabsha's (i.e. the Prophet's) affair has gained power. This is the 
     King of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him." Abu Sufyan added, "By Allah, I 
     remained low and was sure that his religion would be victorious till 
     Allah converted me to Islam, though I disliked it "

     He said, "Migration has passed away with its people." I asked, "For 
     what will you take the pledge of allegiance from us then?" He said, "I
     will take (the pledge) for Islam and Jihad."

     Today a man came to me and asked me a question which I did not know 
     how to answer. He said, "Tell me, if a wealthy active man, 
     well-equipped with arms, goes out on military expeditions with our 
     chiefs, and orders us to do such things as we cannot do (should we 
     obey him?)" I replied, "By Allah, I do not know what to reply you, 
     except that we, were in the company of the Prophet and he used to 
     order us to do a thing once only till we finished it. And no doubt, 
     everyone among you will remain in a good state as long as he obeys 
     Allah. If one is in doubt as to the legality of something, he should 
     ask somebody who would satisfy him, but soon will come a time when you
     will not find such a man. By Him, except Whom none has the right to be

     I participated in a Ghazwa along with Allah's Apostle The Prophet met

     and it had got so tired that it could hardly walk. The Prophet asked 
     me, "What is wrong with the camel?" I replied, "It has got tired." So.
     Allah's Apostle came from behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it 
     so it started surpassing the other camels and going ahead of them. 
     Then he asked me, "How do you find your camel (now)?" I replied, "I 
     find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings." He said, 
     "Will you sell it to me?" I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it 
     was the only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, "Yes." He said, 
     "Sell it to me then." I sold it to him on the condition that I should 
     keep on riding it till I reached Medina. Then I said, "O Allah's 
     Apostle! I am a bridegroom," and requested him to allow me to go home.
     He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the people till I 
     reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and
     I informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the
     permission of Allah's Apostle he asked me whether I had married a 
     virgin or a matron and I replied that I had married a matron. He said,
     "Why hadn't you married a virgin who would have played with you, and 
     you would have played with her?" I replied, "O Allah's Apostle! My 
     father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt
     it not proper that I should marry a young girl like them who would 
     neither teach them manners nor serve them. So, I have married a matron

     companions of 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, "The booty! O people, the 
     booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting 
     for now?" 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, "Have you forgotten what Allah's 
     Apostle said to you?" They replied, "By Allah! We will go to the 
     people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty." But
     when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At 
     that time Allah's Apostle in their rear was calling them back. Only 
     twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred seventy
     men from us.
<p>

     On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his companions had
     caused the 'Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and 
     seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, "Is Muhammad 
     present amongst these people?" The Prophet ordered his companions not 
     to answer him. Then he asked thrice, "Is the son of Abu Quhafa present
     amongst these people?" He asked again thrice, "Is the son of 
     Al-Khattab present amongst these people?" He then returned to his 
     companions and said, "As for these (men), they have been killed." 
     'Umar could not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), "You told a 
     lie, by Allah! O enemy of Allah! All those you have mentioned are 
     alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy is still there." Abu 
     Sufyan said, "Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the 
     battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is 
     shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your 
     (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do 
     not feel sorry for their deed" After that he started reciting 
     cheerfully, "O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his 
     companions), "Why don't you answer him back?" They said, "O Allah's 
     Apostle What shall we say?" He said, "Say, Allah is Higher and more 
     Sublime." (Then) Abu Sufyan said, "We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you
     have no Uzza." The Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you 
     answer him back?" They asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What shall we say?" 
     He said, "Says Allah is our Helper and you have no helper."

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the leadership
     of 'Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of 'Asim bin Umar 
     Al-Khattab. They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between 
     'Usfan, and Mecca, and their news reached a branch of the tribe of 
     Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who were all 
     archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place 
     where they had eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. 
     They said, "These are the dates of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), "and 
     continued following their tracks When 'Asim and his companions saw 
     their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled 
     them. The infidels said to them, "Come down and surrender, and we 
     promise and guarantee you that we will not kill any one of you" 'Asim 
     bin Thabit; the leader of the Sariya said, "By Allah! I will not come 
     down to be under the protection of infidels. O Allah! Convey our news 
     to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they 
     martyred 'Asim along with six other men, and three men came down 
     accepting their promise and convention, and they were 
     Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when the 
     infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied 
     them. Then the third (of the captives) said, "This is the first 
     betrayal. By Allah! I will not go with you. No doubt these, namely the
     martyred, have set a good example to us." So, they dragged him and 
     tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed 
     him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as 
     slaves) in Mecca (and all that took place) after the battle of Badr. 
     Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin 'Amir bin Naufal bin 
     'Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin 'Amir on the 
     day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with 
     those people.
<p>

     Narrated Az-Zuhri: 'Ubaidullah bin 'Iyyad said that the daughter of 
     Al-Harith had told him, "When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) 
     he borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. 
     Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. 
     I saw him placing my son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. I
     got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my face and 
     said, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.' 
     By Allah, I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one 
     day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was 
     chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca." The 
     daughter of Al-Harith used to say, "It was a boon Allah bestowed upon 
     Khubaib." When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill 
     him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer 
     two Rakat (prayer). They allowed him and he offered Two Rakat and then
     said, "Hadn't I been afraid that you would think that I was afraid (of
     being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah, kill them 
     all with no exception." (He then recited the poetic verse):-- "I being
     martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah's Cause, 
     For my killing is for Allah's Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless
     the amputated parts of a torn body" Then the son of Al Harith killed 
     him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced
     to death in captivity, to offer a two-Rak'at prayer (before being 
     killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on that 
     very day on which he was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions
     of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when some 
     infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been killed, they 
     sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which 
     he would be recognized. (That was because) 'Asim had killed one of 
     their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps,
     resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over Asim and protect him
     from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from his
     flesh.

     will go to the (Hell) Fire." Some people were on the point of doubting
     (the truth of what the Prophet had said) while they were in this 
     state, suddenly someone said that he was still alive but severely 
     wounded. When night fell, he lost patience and committed suicide. The 
     Prophet was informed of that, and he said, "Allah is Greater! I 
     testify that I am Allah's Slave and His Apostle." Then he ordered 
     Bilal to announce amongst the people: 'None will enter Paradise but a 
     Muslim, and Allah may support this religion (i.e. Islam) even with a 
     disobedient man.'

     to the Prophet and claimed that they had embraced Islam, and they 
     requested him to support them with some men to fight their own people.
     The Prophet supported them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we 
     used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of piety) used to cut 
     wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the 
     (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi'r-Ma'ana where they 
     betrayed and martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe
