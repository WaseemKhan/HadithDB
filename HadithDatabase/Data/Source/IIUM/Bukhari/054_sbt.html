     Narrated 'Imran bin Husain:
<p>

     Some people of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet and he said (to them), 
     "O Bani Tamim! rejoice with glad tidings." They said, "You have given 
     us glad tidings, now give us something." On hearing that the color of 
     his face changed then the people of Yemen came to him and he said, "O 
     people of Yemen ! Accept the good tidings, as Bani Tamim has refused 
     them." The Yemenites said, "We accept them. Then the Prophet started 
     taking about the beginning of creation and about Allah's Throne. In 
     the mean time a man came saying, "O 'Imran! Your she-camel has run 
     away!'' (I got up and went away), but l wish I had not left that place
     (for I missed what Allah's Apostle had said).

     Narrated Imran bin Husain:
<p>

     I went to the Prophet and tied my she-camel at the gate. The people of
     Bani Tamim came to the Prophet who said "O Bani Tamim! Accept the good
     tidings." They said twice, 'You have given us the good tidings, now 
     give us something" Then some Yemenites came to him and he said, 
     "Accept the good tidings, O people of Yemem, for Bani Tamim refused 
     them." They said, "We accept it, O Allah's Apostle! We have come to 
     ask you about this matter (i.e. the start of creations)." He said, 
     "First of all, there was nothing but Allah, and (then He created His 
     Throne). His throne was over the water, and He wrote everything in the
     Book (in the Heaven) and created the Heavens and the Earth." Then a 
     man shouted, "O Ibn Husain! Your she-camel has gone away!" So, I went 
     away and could not see the she-camel because of the mirage. By Allah, 
     I wished I had left that she-camel (but not that gathering).
<p>

     Narrated 'Umar: One day the Prophet stood up amongst us for a long 
     period and informed us about the beginning of creation (and talked 
     about everything in detail) till he mentioned how the people of 
     Paradise will enter their places and the people of Hell will enter 
     their places. Some remembered what he had said, and some forgot it.

<p>

     The Prophet said, "While I was at the House in a state midway between 
     sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying 
     between two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought 
     to me and my body was cut open from the throat to the lower part of 
     the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with Zam-zam water and (my 
     heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Buraq, a white animal, 
     smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I 
     set out with Gabriel. When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said 
     to the heaven gate-keeper, 'Open the gate.' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who
     is it?' He said, 'Gabriel.' The gate-keeper,' Who is accompanying 
     you?' Gabriel said, 'Muhammad.' The gate-keeper said, 'Has he been 
     called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What 
     a wonderful visit his is!' Then I met Adam and greeted him and he 
     said, 'You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.' Then we ascended to the 
     second heaven. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel said, 'Gabriel.' It 
     was said, 'Who is with you?' He said, 'Muhammad' It was asked, 'Has he
     been sent for?' He said, 'Yes.' It was said, 'He is welcomed. What a 
     wonderful visit his is!" Then I met Jesus and Yahya (John) who said, 
     'You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.' Then we ascended to the 
     third heaven. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel said, 'Gabriel.' It 
     was asked, 'Who is with you? Gabriel said, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 
     'Has he been sent for?' 'Yes,' said Gabriel. 'He is welcomed. What a 
     wonderful visit his is!' (The Prophet added:). There I met Joseph and 
     greeted him, and he replied, 'You are welcomed, O brother and a 
     Prophet!' Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same 
     questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There
     I met Idris and greeted him. He said, 'You are welcomed O brother and 
     Prophet.' Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and again the same 
     questions and answers were exchanged as in previous heavens. there I 
     met and greeted Aaron who said, 'You are welcomed O brother and a 
     Prophet". Then we ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same 
     questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There
     I met and greeted Moses who said, 'You are welcomed O brother and. a 
     Prophet.' When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked 
     why he was weeping, he said, 'O Lord! Followers of this youth who was 
     sent after me will enter Paradise in greater number than my 
     followers.' Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and again the same 
     questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There
     I met and greeted Abraham who said, 'You are welcomed o son and a 
     Prophet.' Then I was shown Al-Bait-al-Ma'mur (i.e. Allah's House). I 
     asked Gabriel about it and he said, This is Al Bait-ul-Ma'mur where 
     70,000 angels perform prayers daily and when they leave they never 
     return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).' Then I 
     was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I 
     saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town
     in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, and four 
     rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two were 
     hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, 'The two 
     hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and 
     the Euphrates.' Then fifty prayers were enjoined on me. I descended 
     till I met Moses who asked me, 'What have you done?' I said, 'Fifty 
     prayers have been enjoined on me.' He said, 'I know the people better 
     than you, because I had the hardest experience to bring Bani Israel to
     obedience. Your followers cannot put up with such obligation. So, 
     return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the number of prayers.'
     I returned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I
     returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then 
     returned again to Allah for reduction and He made it thirty, then 
     twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who repeated the same 
     advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five. When I came to Moses 
     again, he said, 'What have you done?' I said, 'Allah has made it five 
     only.' He repeated the same advice but I said that I surrendered (to 
     Allah's Final Order)'" Allah's Apostle was addressed by Allah, "I have
     decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden on My slaves, and I 
     shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds."

     Allah's Apostle said, "The (Hell) Fire complained to its Lord saying, 
     'O my Lord! My different parts eat up each other.' So, He allowed it 
     to take two breaths, one in the winter and the other in summer, and 
     this is the reason for the severe heat and the bitter cold you find
