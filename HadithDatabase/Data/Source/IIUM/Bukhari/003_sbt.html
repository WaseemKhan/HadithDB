     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a Bedouin came 
     and asked him, "When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place?" Allah's 
     Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah's Apostle 
     had heard the question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. 
     Some of them said that Alllah's Apostle had not heard it. When the 
     Prophet finished his speech, he said, "Where is the questioner, who 
     enquired about the Hour (Doomsday)?" The Bedouin said, "I am here, O 
     Allah's Apostle ." Then the Prophet said, "When honesty is lost, then 
     wait for the Hour (Doomsday)." The Bedouin said, "How will that be 
     lost?" The Prophet said, "When the power or authority comes in the 
     hands of unfit persons, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday.)"

     While we were sitting with the Prophet in the mosque, a man came 
     riding on a camel. He made his camel kneel down in the mosque, tied 
     its foreleg and then said: "Who amongst you is Muhammad?" At that time

     arm. We replied, "This white man reclining on his arm." The an then

     The Prophet said, "I am here to answer your questions." The man said 
     to the Prophet, "I want to ask you something and will be hard in 
     questioning. So do not get angry." The Prophet said, "Ask whatever you
     want." The man said, "I ask you by your Lord, and the Lord of those 
     who were before you, has Allah sent you as an Apostle to all the 
     mankind?" The Prophet replied, "By Allah, yes." The man further said, 
     "I ask you by Allah. Has Allah ordered you to offer five prayers in a 
     day and night (24 hours).? He replied, "By Allah, Yes." The man 
     further said, "I ask you by Allah! Has Allah ordered you to observe 
     fasts during this month of the year (i.e. Ramadan)?" He replied, "By 
     Allah, Yes." The man further said, "I ask you by Allah. Has Allah 
     ordered you to take Zakat (obligatory charity) from our rich people 
     and distribute it amongst our poor people?" The Prophet replied, "By 
     Allah, yes." Thereupon that man said, "I have believed in all that 
     with which you have been sent, and I have been sent by my people as a 
     messenger, and I am Dimam bin Tha'laba from the brothers of Bani Sa'd

     Narrated Abu Jamra:
<p>

     I was an interpreter between the people and Ibn 'Abbas. Once Ibn 
     'Abbas said that a delegation of the tribe of'Abdul Qais came to the 
     Prophet who asked them, "Who are the people (i.e. you)? (Or) who are 
     the delegates?" They replied, "We are from the tribe of Rabi'a." Then 
     the Prophet said to them, "Welcome, O people (or said, "O delegation 
     (of 'Abdul Qais).") Neither will you have disgrace nor will you 
     regret." They said, "We have come to you from a distant place and 
     there is the tribe of the infidels of Mudar intervening between you 
     and us and we cannot come to you except in the sacred month. So please
     order us to do something good (religious deeds) and that we may also 
     inform our people whom we have left behind (at home) and that we may 
     enter Paradise (by acting on them.)" The Prophet ordered them to do 
     four things, and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to 
     believe in Allah Alone, the Honorable the Majestic and said to them, 
     "Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?" They replied,
     "Allah and His Apostle know better." Thereupon the Prophet said, 
     "(That means to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but 
     Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle, to offer prayers perfectly, to
     pay Zakat, to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan, (and) to pay 
     Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's cause)." Then
     he forbade them four things, namely Ad-Dubba.' Hantam, Muzaffat (and) 
     An-Naqir or Muqaiyar(These were the names  of pots in which alcoholic 
     drinks used to be prepared). The Prophet further said, "Memorize them

     behind."

<p>

     I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt Maimuna bint Al-Harith (the
     wife of the Prophet ) while the Prophet was there with her during her 
     night turn. The Prophet offered the 'Isha' prayer (in the mosque), 
     returned home and after having prayed four Rakat, he slept. Later on 
     he got up at night and then asked whether the boy (or he used a 
     similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up 
     by his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five 
     Rakat followed by two more Rakat. Then he slept and I heard him 
     snoring and then (after a while) he left for the (Fajr) prayer.

     Narrated Ubai bin Ka'b:
<p>

     The Prophet said, "Once the Prophet Moses stood up and addressed Bani 
     Israel. He was asked, "Who is the most learned man amongst the people.
     He said, "I am the most learned." Allah admonished Moses as he did not
     attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him 
     "At the junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves 
     who is more learned than you." Moses said, "O my Lord! How can I meet 
     him?" Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and you 
     will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set 
     out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha' bin Nuin and carried a fish 
     in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their 
     heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and 
     it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an amazing 
     thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the 
     rest of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses 
     said to his (servant) boy: "Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have
     suffered much fatigue in this journey." Moses did not get tired till 
     he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy 
     told Moses, "Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I 
     indeed forgot the fish." Moses remarked, "That is what we have been 
     seeking. So they went back retracing their foot-steps, till they 
     reached the rock. There they saw a man covered with a garment (or 
     covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir 
     replied saying, "How do people greet each other in your land?" Moses 
     said, "I am Moses." He asked, "The Moses of Bani Israel?" Moses 
     replied in the affirmative and added, "May I follow you so that you 
     teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught." Al-Khadir 
     replied, "Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O 
     Moses! I have some of the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me 
     and which you do not know, while you have some knowledge which Allah 
     has taught you which I do not know." Moses said, "Allah willing, you 
     will find me patient and I will not disobey you in aught. So both of 
     them set out walking along the sea-shore, as they did not have a boat.
     In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the crew of 
     the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took
     them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge 
     of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir 
     said: "O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased 
     Allah's knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the 
     water of the sea with its beak." Al-Khadir went to one of the planks 
     of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, "These people gave us a 
     free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to 
     drown its people." Al-Khadir replied, "Didn't I tell you that you will
     not be able to remain patient with me." Moses said, "Call me not to 
     account for what I forgot." The first (excuse) of Moses was that he 
     had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing 
     with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy's head from the top 
     and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, "Have
     you killed an innocent soul who has killed none." Al-Kha,dir replied, 
     "Did I not tell you that you cannot remain patient with me?" Then they
     both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they asked
     them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found 
     there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with 
     his own hands. Moses said, "If you had wished, surely you could have 
     taken wages for it." Al-Khadir replied, "This is the parting between 
     you and me." The Prophet added, "May Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would
     that he could have been more patient to learn more about his story 
     with Al-Khadir. "
