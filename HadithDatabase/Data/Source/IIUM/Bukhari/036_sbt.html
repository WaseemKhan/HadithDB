     The Prophet and Abu Bakr employed a (pagan) man from the tribe of Bani
     Ad-Dail and the tribe of Bani 'Abu bin 'Adi as a guide. He was an 
     expert guide and he broke the oath contract which he had to abide by 
     with the tribe of Al-'Asi bin Wail and he was on the religion of 
     Quraish pagans. The Prophet and Abu Bakr had confidence in him and 
     gave him their riding camels and told him to bring them to the Cave of
     Thaur after three days. So, he brought them their two riding camels 
     after three days and both of them (The Prophet and Abu Bakr) set out 
     accompanied by 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the Dili guide who guided them 
     below Mecca along the road leading to the sea-shore.

     the Prophet (with a complaint) but the Prophet cancelled the suit and

     mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?"

     Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:
<p>

     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Three men from among those who were 
     before you, set out together till they reached a cave at night and 
     entered it. A big rock rolled down the mountain and closed the mouth 
     of the cave. They said (to each other), Nothing could save you Tom 
     this rock but to invoke Allah by giving referenda to the righteous 
     deed which you have done (for Allah's sake only).' So, one of them 
     said, 'O Allah! I had old parents and I never provided my family 
     (wife, children etc.) with milk before them. One day, by chance I was 
     delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had slept. I milked the
     sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I
     disliked to provide my family with the milk before them. I waited for 
     them and the bowl of milk was in my hand and I kept on waiting for 
     them to get up till the day dawned. Then they got up and drank the 
     milk. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us 
     from our critical situation caused by this rock.' So, the rock shifted
     a little but they could not get out."
<p>

     The Prophet added, "The second man said, 'O Allah! I had a cousin who 
     was the dearest of all people to me and I wanted to have sexual 
     relations with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a 
     famine year and she came to me and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty 
     Dinars on the condition that she would not resist my desire, and she 
     agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is illegal
     for you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I 
     thought it a sin to have sexual intercourse with her and left her 
     though she was the dearest of all the people to me, and also I left 
     the gold I had given her. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, 
     please relieve us from the present calamity.' So, the rock shifted a 
     little more but still they could not get out from there."
<p>

     The Prophet added, "Then the third man said, 'O Allah! I employed few 
     laborers and I paid them their wages with the exception of one man who
     did not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages and I got 
     much property thereby. (Then after some time) he came and said to me: 
     O Allah's slave! Pay me my wages. I said to him: All the camels, cows,
     sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O Allah's slave! Don't 
     mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd 
     and drove them away and left nothing. O Allah! If I did that for Your 
     Sake only, please relieve us from the present suffering.' So, that 
     rock shifted completely and they got out walking.

<p>

     Some of the companions of the Prophet went on a journey till they 
     reached some of the 'Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to 
     treat them as their guests but they refused. The chief of that tribe 
     was then bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and they tried 
     their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said (to the others),
     "Nothing has benefited him, will you go to the people who resided here
     at night, it may be that some of them might possess something (as 
     treatment)," They went to the group of the companions (of the Prophet 
     ) and said, "Our chief has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a 
     scorpion) and we have tried everything but he has not benefitted. Have
     you got anything (useful)?" One of them replied, "Yes, by Allah! I can
     recite a Ruqya, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I
     will not recite the Ruqya for you unless you fix for us some wages for
     it." They agrees to pay them a flock of sheep. One of them then went 
     and recited (Suratul-Fatiha): 'All the praises are for the Lord of the
     Worlds' and puffed over the chief who became all right as if he was 
     released from a chain, and got up and started walking, showing no 
     signs of sickness.
<p>

     They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the 
     companions) then  suggested to divide their earnings among themselves,
     but the one who performed the recitation said, "Do not divide them 
     till we go to the Prophet and narrate the whole story to him, and wait
     for his order." So, they went to Allah's Apostle and narrated the 
     story. Allah's Apostle asked, "How did you come to know that 
     Surat-ul-Fatiha was recited as Ruqya?" Then he added, "You have done 
     the right thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for 
     me as well." The Prophet smiled thereupon.
