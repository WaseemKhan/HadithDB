     Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:
<p>

     My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his 
     companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was
     informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded 
     onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them 
     laughed among themselves. (My father said), "I looked up and saw an 
     onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my 
     companions' help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its 
     meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the
     Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at
     a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at 
     other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at 
     midnight. I asked him, "Where did you leave the Prophet ?" He replied,
     "I left him at Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday 
     rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and 
     said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their 
     compliments, and (ask for) Allah's Blessings upon you. They are afraid
     lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.' I added, 'O 
     Allah's Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. 
     The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the 
     state of Ihram."

     stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they 
     refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its 
     meat). Then I followed Allah's Apostle lest we should be left behind. 
     At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other 
     times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe
     of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah's 
     Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place 
     called Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at 
     As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah's Apostle till I reached him and said, 
     "O Allah's Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you 
     their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah's Mercy and 
     Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene

     said, "O Allah's Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it
     (i.e. its meat) left over." Allah's Apostle told his companions to eat
     the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram."

     Narrated Abu Qatada:
<p>

     We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which
     is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada 
     narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of
     the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram
     while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were 
     watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse
     and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them 
     to pick it up for me) but they said, "We will not help you by any 
     means as we are in a state of Ihram." So, I picked up the whip myself 
     and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and 
     brought it to my companions. Some of them said, "Eat it." While some 
     others said, "Do not eat it." So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead 
     of us and asked him about it, He replied, "Eat it as it is Halal (i.e.
     it is legal to eat it)."

<p>

     That his father had told him that Allah's Apostle set out for Hajj and
     so did his companions. He sent a batch of his companions by another 
     route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, 
     "Proceed along the sea-shore till we meet all together." So, they took
     the route of the sea-shore, and when they started all of them assumed 
     Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions
     saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and
     wounded a she-onager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said 
     to each other: "How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a 
     state of Ihram?" So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager's 
     meat, and when they met Allah's Apostle they asked, saying, "O Allah's
     Apostle! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw 
     (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a 
     she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, 
     we said, (to each other), 'How do we eat the meat of the game and we 
     are in a state of Ihram?' So, we carried the rest of its meat. The 
     Prophet asked, "Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or 
     point at it?" They replied in the negative. He said, "Then eat what is
     left of its meat."

     for a two-days' journey.
