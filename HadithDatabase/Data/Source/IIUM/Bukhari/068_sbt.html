     Narrated Al-Bara:
<p>

     The Prophet said (on the day of Idal-Adha), "The first thing we will 
     do on this day of ours, is to offer the ('Id) prayer and then return 
     to slaughter the sacrifice. Whoever does so, he acted according to our
     Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the 
     prayer, what he offered was just meat he presented to his family, and 
     that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice)." (On hearing that) 
     Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice 
     before the prayer, and said, "I have got a six month old ram." The 
     Prophet said, 'Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be 
     sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you).  Al-Bara' 
     added: The Prophet said, "Whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) after 
     the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the 
     tradition of the Muslims."

     that she would not be able to perform the Hajj). The Prophet said, 
     "What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?" She said, "Yes." 
     He said, "This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of 
     Adam, so perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the others, but do 
     not perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba." 'Aisha added: When we were at
     Mina, beef was brought to me and I asked, "What is this?" They (the 
     people) said, "Allah's Apostle has slaughtered some cows as sacrifices
     on behalf of his wives."

     sacrifice)." A man got up and said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is a day 
     on which meat is desired." He then mentioned his neighbors saying, "I 
     have a six month old ram which is to me better than the meat of two 
     sheep." The Prophet allowed him to slaughter it as a sacrifice, but I 
     do not know whether this permission was valid for other than that man 
     or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, 
     and then the people went towards some sheep and distributed them among
     themselves.

     Narrated Abu Bakra:
<p>

     The Prophet said, "Time has come back to its original state which it 
     had on the day Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is 
     twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in 
     succession, namely Dhul-Qa'da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth 
     being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma'da (ath-thamj and Sha'ban. 
     The Prophet then asked, "Which month is this?" We said, "Allah and his
     Apostle know better." He kept silent so long that we thought that he 
     would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, "Isn't it 
     the month of Dhul-Hijja?" We said, "Yes." He said, "Which town is 
     this?" We said, "Allah and His Apostle know better." He kept silent so
     long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its 
     real name. He said,  "isn't it the town (of Mecca)?" We replied, 
     "Yes." He said, "What day is today?" We replied, "Allah and His 
     Apostle know better." He kept silent so long that we thought that he 
     would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, "Isn't it 
     the day of Nahr?" We replied, "Yes." He then said, "Your blood, 
     properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours
     in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord,
     and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after 
     me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who 
     are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some 
     of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of 
     those who have heard it directly." (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on 
     mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, "No doubt! Haven't
     I delivered (Allah's) Message (to you)? Haven't I delivered Allah's 
     message (to you)?"
