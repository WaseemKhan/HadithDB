     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is! 
     Were it not for some men who dislike to be left behind and for whom I 
     do not have means of conveyance, I would not stay away (from any Holy 
     Battle). I would love to be martyred in Allah's Cause and come to life
     and then get, martyred and then come to life and then get martyred and
     then get resurrected and then get martyred.

     Abu Huraira said, Allah's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hand my life 
     is, I would love to fight in Allah's Cause and then get martyred and 
     then resurrected (come to life) and then get martyred and then 
     resurrected (come to life) and then get martyred, and then resurrected
     (come to life) and then get martyred and then resurrected (come to

     testify to it with Allah's Oath.

     Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:
<p>

     We were in the company of Allah's Apostle and we assumed the state of 
     Ihram of Hajj and arrived at Mecca on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. The 
     Prophet ordered us to perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba and (Sa'i) 
     between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and use our lhram just for 'Umra, and 
     finish the state of Ihram unless we had our Hadi with us. None of us 
     had the Hadi with him except the Prophet and Talha. 1AIj came from 
     Yemen and brought the Hadi with him. 'Ali said, 'I had assumed the 
     state of Ihram with the same intention as that with which Allah's 
     Apostle had assumed it. The people said, "How can we proceed to Mina 
     and our male organs are dribbling?" Allah's Apostle said, "If I had 
     formerly known what I came to know latterly, I would not have brought 
     the Hadi, and had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished my
     Ihram." Suraqa (bin Malik) met the Prophet while he was throwing 
     pebbles at the Jamrat-al-'Aqaba, and asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Is 
     this (permitted) for us only?" The Prophet replied. "No, it is 
     forever" 'Aisha had arrived at Mecca while she was menstruating, 
     therefore the Prophet ordered her to perform all the ceremonies of 
     Hajj except the Tawaf around the Ka'ba, and not to perform her prayers
     unless and until she became clean . When they encamped at Al-Batha, 
     'Aisha said, "O Allah's Apostle! You are proceeding after performing 
     both Hajj and 'Umra while I am proceeding with Hajj only?" So the 
     Prophet ordered 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to go with her to
     At-Tan'im, and so she performed the 'Umra in Dhul-Hijja after the days
     of the Hajj.

     Narrated Aisha:
<p>

     One night the Prophet was unable to sleep and said, "Would that a 
     righteous man from my companions guarded me tonight." Suddenly we 
     heard the clatter of arms, whereupon the Prophet said, "Who is it?" It
     was said, "I am Sa'd, O Allah's Apostle! I have come to guard you." 
     The Prophet then slept so soundly that we heard him snoring. Abu 
     'Abdullah said: 'Aisha said: Bilal said, "Would that I but stayed 
     overnight in a valley with Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of grass) 
     around me (i.e., in Mecca)." Then I told that to the Prophet .

     whiteness of his abdomen, and he (the Prophet ) was saying, "(O Allah)

     in charity, nor would we have prayed. So (O Allah!) please send 
     tranquility (Sakina) upon us as they, (the chiefs of the enemy tribes)
     have rebelled against us. And if they intend affliction (i.e. want to 
     frighten us and fight against us) then we would not (flee but
