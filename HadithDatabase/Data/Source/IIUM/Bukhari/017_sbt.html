     Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the bowing in the 
     last Raka he used to say: "O Allah! Save 'Aiyash bin Abi Rabi'a. O 
     Allah! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah! Save Walid bin Walid. O Allah!
     Save the weak faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribes of 
     Mudar and send (famine) years on them like the famine years of 
     (Prophet) Joseph ." The Prophet further said, "Allah forgive the 
     tribes of Ghifar and save the tribes of Aslam." Abu Az-Zinad (a 
     sub-narrator) said, "The Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in 
     the Fajr prayer."

     Narrated Masruq:
<p>

     We were with 'Abdullah and he said, "When the Prophet saw the refusal 
     of the people to accept Islam he said, "O Allah! Send (famine) years 
     on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the 
     time) of (Prophet) Joseph." So famine overtook them for one year and 
     destroyed every kind of life to such an extent that the people started
     eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals. Whenever one of them 
     looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke 
     because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, "O 
     Muhammad! You order people to obey Allah and to keep good relations 
     with kith and kin. No doubt the people of your tribe are dying, so 
     please pray to Allah for them." So Allah revealed: "Then watch you For
     the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible 
     ... Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall 
     seize You with a mighty grasp. (44.10-16) Ibn Masud added, "Al-Batsha 
     (i.e. grasp) happened in the battle of Badr and no doubt smoke, 
     Al-Batsha, Al-Lizam, and the verse of Surat Ar-Rum have all passed .

     I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "On a Friday a person entered the main 
     Mosque through the gate facing the pulpit while Allah's Apostle was 
     delivering the Khutba. The man stood in front of Allah's Apostle and 
     said, 'O Allah's Apostle! The livestock are dying and the roads are 
     cut off; so please pray to Allah for rain.' " Anas added, "Allah's

     with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain! O Allah! Bless us with rain!'

     sky and there was no building or a house between us and (the mountains
     of) Sila." Anas added, "A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from 
     behind it (i.e. Sila' Mountain). When it came in the middle of the 
     sky, it spread and then rained." Anas further said, "By Allah! We 
     could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through
     the same gate and at that time Allah's Apostle was delivering the 
     Friday's Khutba. The man stood in front of him and said, 'O Allah's

     pray to Allah to with-hold rain.' " Anas added, "Allah's Apostle I

     us. O Allah! On the plateaus, on the mountains, on the hills, in the 
     valleys and on the places where trees grow.' So the rain stopped and

     One day I went to Ibn Masud  who said, "When Quraish delayed in 
     embracing Islam, the Prophet I invoked Allah to curse them, so they 
     were afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many of them died
     and they ate the carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and 
     said, 'O Muhammad! You came to order people to keep good relation with
     kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so invoke Allah I ? 
     So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: 'Then 
     watch you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke 
     Plainly visible.' (44.10) When the famine was taken off, the people 
     renegade once again as nonbelievers. The statement of Allah, (in Sura 
     "Ad-Dukhan"-44) refers to that: 'On the day when We shall seize You 
     with a mighty grasp.' (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of
     the battle of Badr." Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, "Allah's
     Apostle prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the 
     people complained of the excessive rain. The Prophet said, 'O Allah! 
     (Let it rain) around us and not on us.' So the clouds dispersed over

     the sky and suddenly the sky became overcast with clouds and it 
     started raining. The Prophet came down the pulpit and offered the

     Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "Keys of the unseen knowledge are five
     which nobody knows but Allah . . . nobody knows what will happen 
     tomorrow; nobody knows what is in the womb; nobody knows what he will 
     gain tomorrow; nobody knows at what place he will die; and nobody 
     knows when it will rain."
