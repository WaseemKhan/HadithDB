     said, "No." I said, "Half of it?" He said, "No." I said, "One third of
     it?" He said, "One-third (is alright), yet it is still too much, for 
     you'd better leave your inheritors wealthy than leave them poor, 
     begging of others. Whatever you spend will be considered a Sadaqa for 
     you, even the mouthful of food you put in the mouth of your wife. 
     Anyhow Allah may let you recover, so that some people may benefit by 
     you and others be harmed by you."

<p>

     Narrated Malik bin Aus bin Al-Hadathan:
<p>

     Once I set out to visit 'Umar (bin Al-Khattab). (While I was sitting 
     there with him his gate-keeper, Yarfa, came and said, "Uthman 
     AbdurRahman (bin 'Auf), Az-Zubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) are seeking
     permission (to meet you)." 'Umar said, "Yes. So he admitted them and 
     they entered, greeted, and sat down. After a short while Yarfa came 
     again and said to 'Umar 'Shall I admit 'Ali and 'Abbas?" 'Umar said, 
     "Yes." He admitted them and when they entered, they greeted and sat 
     down. 'Abbas said, "O Chief of the Believers! Judge between me and 
     this ('Ali)." The group, 'Uthman and his companions Sad, 'O Chief of 
     the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other." 
     'Umar said. Wait! I beseech you by Allah, by Whose permission both the
     Heaven and the Earth stand fast ! Do you know that Allah's Apostle 
     said. 'We (Apostles) do not bequeath anything to our heirs, but 
     whatever we leave is to be given in charity.' And by that Allah's 
     Apostles meant himself?" The group said, "He did say so." 'Umar then 
     turned towards 'All and 'Abbas and said. "I beseech you both by Allah,
     do you know that Allah's Apostle said that?" They said, 'Yes " 'Umar 
     said, "Now, let me talk to you about this matter. Allah favored His 
     Apostle with something of this property (war booty) which He did not 
     give to anybody else. And Allah said:-- 'And what Allah has bestowed 
     on His Apostle (as Fai Booty) from them for which you made no 
     expedition with either cavalry or camelry . . . Allah is Able to do 
     all things.' (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Allah's
     Apostle. But by Allah he neither withheld it from you, nor did he keep
     it for himself and deprive you of it, but he gave it all to you and 
     distributed it among you till only this remained out of it. And out of
     this property Allah's Apostle used to provide his family with their 
     yearly needs, and whatever remained, he would spend where Allah's 
     Property (the revenues of Zakat) used to be spent. Allah's Apostle 
     kept on acting like this throughout his lifetime. Now I beseech you by
     Allah, do you know that?" They said, "Yes." Then 'Umar said to 'Ali 
     and 'Abbas, "I beseech you by Allah, do you both know that?" They 
     said, "Yes." 'Umar added, "When Allah had taken His Apostle unto Him, 
     Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Apostle. So he took 
     charge of that property and did with it the same what Allah's Apostle 
     used to do, and both of you knew all about it then." Then 'Umar turned
     towards 'Ali and Abbas and said, "You both claim that Abu- Bakr was 
     so-and-so! But Allah knows that he was honest, sincere, pious and 
     right (in that matter). Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die, and i said,
     'I am the successor of Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr.' So I kept this 
     property in my possession for the first two years of my rule, and I 
     used to do the same with it as Allah's Apostle  and Abu Bakr used to 
     do. Later both of you ('Ali and 'Abbas) came to me with the same claim
     and the same problem. (O 'Abbas!) You came to me demanding your share 
     from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he ('Ali) came 
     to me demanding his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. 
     So I said to you, 'If you wish I will hand over this property to you, 
     on condition that you both promise me before Allah that you will 
     manage it in the same way as Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as 
     I have done since the beginning of my rule; otherwise you should not 
     speak to me about it.' So you both said, 'Hand over this property to 
     us on this condition.' And on this condition I handed it over to you. 
     I beseech you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on that condition?"
     The group said, "Yes." 'Umar then faced 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, "I 
     beseech you both by Allah, did I hand it over to you both on that 
     condition?" They both said, "Yes." 'Umar added, "Do you want me now to
     give a decision other than that? By Him with Whose permission (order) 
     both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any 
     decision other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are 
     unable to manage it (that property), then return it to me and I will 
     be sufficient for it on your behalf . "
