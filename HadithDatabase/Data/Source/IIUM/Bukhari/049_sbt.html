     Narrated Sahl bin Sad:
<p>

     There was a dispute amongst the people of the tribe of Bani 'Amr bin 
     'Auf. The Prophet went to them along with some of his companions in 
     order to make peace between them. The time for the prayer became due 
     but the Prophet did not turn up; Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. 
     call) for the prayer but the Prophet did not turn up, so Bilal went to
     Abu Bakr and said, "The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet i 
     detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, 
     "Yes, you wish." So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu 
     Bakr went ahead (to lead the prayer), but the Prophet came walking 
     among the rows till he joined the first row. The people started 
     clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look 
     hither and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the 
     Prophet standing behind him. The Prophet beckoned him with his hand to
     keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hand and praised 
     Allah and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the 
     Prophet went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet
     finished the prayer, he turned towards the people and said, "O people!
     When something happens to you during the prayer, you start clapping. 
     Really clapping is (permissible) for women only. If something happens 
     to one of you in his prayer, he should say: 'Subhan Allah', (Glorified
     be Allah), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention
     towards him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in
     the prayer when I beckoned to you (to continue)?" Abu Bakr replied, 
     "It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa to lead the prayer in front of
     the Prophet.

     Narrated Anas:
<p>

     It was said to the Prophet "Would that you see Abdullah bin Ubai." So,
     the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims accompanied 
     him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached 'Abdullah 
     bin Ubai, the latter said, "Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell
     of your donkey has harmed me." On that an Ansari man said (to 
     'Abdullah), "By Allah! The smell of the donkey of Allah's Apostle is 
     better than your smell." On that a man from 'Abdullah's tribe got 
     angry for 'Abdullah's sake, and the two men abused each other which 
     caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups 
     started fighting with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that 
     the following Divine Verse was revealed (in this concern):-- "And if 
     two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace between 
     them."   (49.9)

     hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the 
     learned scholars who said, "Your son has to be lashed one-hundred 
     lashes and has to be exiled for one year." The Prophet said, "No doubt
     I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and
     the sheep are to go back to you, and your son will get a hundred 
     lashes and one year exile." He then addressed somebody, "O Unais! go 
     to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death" So, Unais went and 
     stoned her to death.

     Narrated Al-Bara:
<p>

     When the Prophet intended to perform 'Umra in the month of Dhul-Qada, 
     the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the 
     matter with them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When 
     the document of treaty was written, the following was mentioned: 
     'These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah's Apostle agreed (to 
     make peace).' They said, "We will not agree to this, for if we 
     believed that you are Allah's Apostle we would not prevent you, but 
     you are Muhammad bin 'Abdullah." The Prophet said, "I am Allah's 
     Apostle and also Muhammad bin 'Abdullah." Then he said to 'Ali, "Rub 
     off (the words) 'Allah's Apostle' ", but 'Ali said, "No, by Allah, I 
     will never rub off your name." So, Allah's Apostle took the document 
     and wrote, 'This is what Muhammad bin 'Abdullah has agreed upon: No 
     arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from
     the people of Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet )
     even if he wished to follow him and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent
     any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the latter wants to 
     stay.' When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the 
     Meccans went to 'Ali and said, "Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) 
     to go out, as the period (agreed to) has passed." So, the Prophet went
     out of Mecca. The daughter of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet 
     and his companions), calling, "O Uncle! O Uncle!" 'Ali received her 
     and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, "Take your uncle's 
     daughter." Zaid and Ja'far quarrel ed about her. 'Ali said, "I have 
     more right to her as she is my uncle's daughter." Ja'far said, "She is
     my uncle's daughter, and her aunt is my wife." Zaid said, "She is my 
     brother's daughter." The Prophet judged that she should be given to 
     her aunt, and said that the aunt was like the mother. He then said to 
     'All, "You are from me and I am from you", and said to Ja'far, "You 
     resemble me both in character and appearance", and said to Zaid, "You 
     are our brother (in faith) and our freed slave."

     prevented him from reaching the Ka'ba. So, he slaughtered his 
     sacrifice and got his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with 
     them that he would perform 'Umra the following year and would not 
     carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca except for the
     period they al lowed. So, the Prophet performed the 'Umra in the 
     following year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he 
     stayed for three days, the pagans ordered him to depart, and he

     about retaliation. Anas bin An-Nadr asked, "O Allah"; Apostle! Will 
     the tooth of Ar-Rabi' be broken? No, by Him Who has sent you with the 
     Truth, her tooth will not be broken." The Prophet said, "O Anas!

     agreed and forgave her. The Prophet said, "There are some of Allah's

     By Allah, Al-Hasan bin Ali led large battalions like mountains against
     Muawiya. Amr bin Al-As said (to Muawiya), "I surely see battalions 
     which will not turn back before killing their opponents." Muawiya who 
     was really the best of the two men said to him, "O 'Amr! If these 
     killed those and those killed these, who would be left with me for the
     jobs of the public, who would be left with me for their women, who 
     would be left with me for their children?" Then Muawiya sent two 
     Quraishi men from the tribe of 'Abd-i-Shams called 'Abdur Rahman bin 
     Sumura and Abdullah bin 'Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, 
     "Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and negotiate peace with him and talk 
     and appeal to him." So, they went to Al-Hasan and talked and appealed 
     to him to accept peace. Al-Hasan said, "We, the offspring of 'Abdul 
     Muttalib, have got wealth and people have indulged in killing and 
     corruption (and money only will appease them)." They said to Al-Hasan,
     "Muawiya offers you so and so, and appeals to you and entreats you to 
     accept peace." Al-Hasan said to them, "But who will be responsible for
     what you have said?" They said, "We will be responsible for it." So, 
     what-ever Al-Hasan asked they said, "We will be responsible for it for
     you." So, Al-Hasan concluded a peace treaty with Muawiya. Al-Hasan 
     (Al-Basri) said: I heard Abu Bakr saying, "I saw Allah's Apostle on 
     the pulpit and Al-Hasan bin 'Ali was by his side. The Prophet was 
     looking once at the people and once at Al-Hasan bin 'Ali saying, 'This
     son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may Allah make peace
