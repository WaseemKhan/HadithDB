     Narrated Malik:
<p>

     We came to the Prophet and we were young men nearly of equal ages and 
     we stayed with him for twenty nights. Allah's Apostle was a very kind 
     man and when he realized our longing for our families, he asked us 
     about those whom we had left behind. When we informed him, he said, 
     "Go back to your families and stay with them and teach them (religion)
     and order them (to do good deeds). The Prophet mentioned things some 
     of which I remembered and some I did not. Then he said, "Pray as you 
     have seen me praying, and when it is the time of prayer, one of you 
     should pronounce the call (Adhan) for the prayer and the eldest of you
     should lead the prayer. "

     Allah's Apostle said, "The (call for prayer) Adhan of Bilal should not

     in order that whoever among you is praying the night prayer, may 
     return (to eat his Suhur) and whoever among you is sleeping, may get 
     up, for it is not yet dawn (when it is like this)." (Yahya, the

     another two Rakat and then finished prayer with Taslim, and then said 
     the Takbir and performed a prostration similar to or longer than his 
     ordinary prostrations; then he raised his head, said Takbir and

     When Allah's Apostle arrived at Medina, he prayed facing Jerusalem for
     sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that he would be ordered to 
     face the Ka'ba. So Allah revealed: --
<p>

     'Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven; 
     surely we shall turn you to a prayer direction (Qibla) that shall 
     please you.' (2.144) Thus he was directed towards the Ka'ba. A man 
     prayed the 'Asr prayer with the Prophet and then went out, and passing
     by some people from the Ansar, he said, "I testify. that I have prayed
     with the Prophet and he (the Prophet) has prayed facing the Ka'ba." 
     Thereupon they, who were bowing in the 'Asr prayer, turned towards the
     Ka'ba.
