     Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf:
<p>

     I got an agreement written between me and Umaiya bin Khalaf that 
     Umaiya would look after my property (or family) in Mecca and I would 
     look after his in Medina. When I mentioned the word 'Ar-Rahman' in the
     documents, Umaiya said, "I do not know 'Ar-Rahman.' Write down to me 
     your name, (with which you called yourself) in the Pre-lslamic Period 
     of Ignorance." So, I wrote my name ' 'Abdu 'Amr'. On the day (of the 
     battle) of Badr, when all the people went to sleep, I went up the hill
     to protect him. Bilal(1) saw him (i.e. Umaiya) and went to a gathering
     of Ansar and said, "(Here is) Umaiya bin Khalaf! Woe to me if he 
     escapes!" So, a group of Ansar went out with Bilal to follow us 
     ('Abdur-Rahman and Umaiya). Being afraid that they would catch us, I 
     left Umaiya's son for them to keep them busy but the Ansar killed the 
     son and insisted on following us. Umaiya was a fat man, and when they 
     approached us, I told him to kneel down, and he knelt, and I laid 
     myself on him to protect him, but the Ansar killed him by passing 
     their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my foot with his 
     sword. (The sub narrator said, " 'Abdur-Rahman used to show us the 
     trace of the wound on the back of his foot.")

     Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle employed someone as a governor at Khaibar. When the 
     man came to Medina, he brought with him dates called Janib. The 
     Prophet asked him, "Are all the dates of Khaibar of this kind?" The 
     man replied, "(No), we exchange two Sa's of bad dates for one Sa of 
     this kind of dates (i.e. Janib), or exchange three Sa's for two." On 
     that, the Prophet said, "Don't do so, as it is a kind of usury (Riba) 
     but sell the dates of inferior quality for money, and then buy Janib 
     with the money". The Prophet said the same thing about dates sold by 
     weight. (See Hadith No. 506).

     We had some sheep which used to graze at Sala'. One of our slavegirls 
     saw a sheep dying and she broke a stone and slaughtered the sheep with
     it. My father said to the people, "Don't eat it till I ask the Prophet
     about it (or till I send somebody to ask the Prophet)." So, he asked 
     or sent somebody to ask the Prophet, and the Prophet permitted him to

     though she was a slave-girl, she dared to slaughter the sheep . "

     Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:
<p>

     When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing Islam, came
     to Allah's Apostle, he got up. They appealed to him to return their 
     properties and their captives. Allah's Apostle said to them, "The most
     beloved statement to me is the true one. So, you have the option of 
     restoring your properties or your captives, for I have delayed 
     distributing them." The narrator added, Allah's Apostle c had been 
     waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When 
     they realized that Allah's Apostle would return to them only one of 
     two things, they said, "We choose our captives." So, Allah's Apostle 
     got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised Allah as He deserved, 
     and said, "Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you with 
     repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, 
     whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, 
     and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from 
     the very first booty which Allah will give us then he can do so." The 
     people replied, "We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor 
     for Allah's Apostle." Then Allah's Apostle said, "We don't know who 
     amongst you has agreed and who hasn't. Go back and your chiefs may 
     tell us your opinion." So, all of them returned and their chiefs 
     discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their chiefs) came 
     to Allah's Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given 
     up their shares gladly and willingly.

     Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:
<p>

     I was accompanying the Prophet on a journey and was riding a slow 
     camel that was lagging behind the others. The Prophet passed by me and
     asked, "Who is this?" I replied, "Jabir bin 'Abdullah." He asked, 
     "What is the matter, (why are you late)?" I replied, "I am riding a 
     slow camel." He asked, "Do you have a stick?" I replied in the 
     affirmative. He said, "Give it to me." When I gave it to him, he beat 
     the camel and rebuked it. Then that camel surpassed the others 
     thenceforth. The Prophet said, "Sell it to me." I replied, "It is (a 
     gift) for you, O Allah's Apostle." He said, "Sell it to me. I have 
     bought it for four Dinars (gold pieces) and you can keep on riding it 
     till Medina." When we approached Medina, I started going (towards my 
     house). The Prophet said, "Where are you going?" I Sad, "I have 
     married a widow." He said, "Why have you not married a virgin to 
     fondle with each other?" I said, "My father died and left daughters, 
     so I decided to marry a widow (an experienced woman) (to look after 
     them)." He said, "Well done." When we reached Medina, Allah's Apostle 
     said, "O Bilal, pay him (the price of the camel) and give him extra 
     money." Bilal gave me four Dinars and one Qirat extra. (A sub-narrator
     said): Jabir added, "The extra Qirat of Allah's Apostle never parted 
     from me." The Qirat was always in Jabir bin 'Abdullah's purse.

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle deputed me to keep Sadaqat (al-Fitr) of Ramadan. A 
     comer came and started taking handfuls of the foodstuff (of the 
     Sadaqa) (stealthily). I took hold of him and said, "By Allah, I will 
     take you to Allah's Apostle ." He said, "I am needy and have many 
     dependents, and I am in great need." I released him, and in the 
     morning Allah's Apostle asked me, "What did your prisoner do 
     yesterday?" I said, "O Allah's Apostle! The person complained of being
     needy and of having many dependents, so, I pitied him and let him go."
     Allah's Apostle said, "Indeed, he told you a lie and he will be coming
     again." I believed that he would show up again as Allah's Apostle had 
     told me that he would return. So, I waited for him watchfully. When he
     (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of foodstuff, I caught hold 
     of him again and said, "I will definitely take you to Allah's Apostle.
     He said, "Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I 
     promise I will not come back again." I pitied him and let him go. 
<p>

     In the morning Allah's Apostle asked me, "What did your prisoner do." 
     I replied, "O Allah's Apostle! He complained of his great need and of 
     too many dependents, so I took pity on him and set him free." Allah's 
     Apostle said, "Verily, he told you a lie and he will return." I waited
     for him attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started
     stealing handfuls of the foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, "I 
     will surely take you to Allah's Apostle as it is the third time you 
     promise not to return, yet you break your promise and come." He said, 
     "(Forgive me and) I will teach you some words with which Allah will 
     benefit you." I asked, "What are they?" He replied, "Whenever you go 
     to bed, recite "Ayat-al-Kursi"-- 'Allahu la ilaha illa huwa-l-Haiy-ul 
     Qaiyum' till you finish the whole verse. (If you do so), Allah will 
     appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no satan will come 
     near you till morning. " So, I released him. In the morning, Allah's 
     Apostle asked, "What did your prisoner do yesterday?" I replied, "He 
     claimed that he would teach me some words by which Allah will benefit 
     me, so I let him go." Allah's Apostle asked, "What are they?" I 
     replied, "He said to me, 'Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-al-Kursi
     from the beginning to the end ---- Allahu la ilaha illa 
     huwa-lHaiy-ul-Qaiyum----.' He further said to me, '(If you do so), 
     Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you, and no 
     satan will come near you till morning.' (Abu Huraira or another 
     sub-narrator) added that they (the companions) were very keen to do 
     good deeds. The Prophet said, "He really spoke the truth, although he 
     is an absolute liar. Do you know whom you were talking to, these three
     nights, O Abu Huraira?" Abu Huraira said, "No." He said, "It was 
     Satan."
