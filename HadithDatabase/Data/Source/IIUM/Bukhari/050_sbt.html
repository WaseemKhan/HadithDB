     Narrated Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama:
<p>

     (from the companions of Allah's Apostle) When Suhail bin Amr agreed to
     the Treaty (of Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was 
     that the Prophet should return to them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming
     to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and would not 
     interfere between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this 
     condition and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with 
     that condition. So, the Prophet agreed to that condition and returned 
     Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin 'Amr. Thenceforward the Prophet 
     returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a Muslim. 
     During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kalthum
     bint Uqba bin Abu Muait who came to Allah's Apostle and she was a 
     young lady then. Her relative came to the Prophet and asked him to 
     return her, but the Prophet did not return her to them for Allah had 
     revealed the following Verse regarding women:
<p>

     "O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants.
     Examine them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know 
     them for true believers, Send them not back to the unbelievers, (for) 
     they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers, Nor are the 
     unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them (60.10)
<p>

     Narrated 'Urwa: Aisha told me, "Allah's Apostle used to examine them 
     according to this Verse: "O you who believe! When the believing women 
     come to you, as emigrants test them . . . for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, 
     Most Merciful." (60.10-12) Aisha said, "When any of them agreed to 
     that condition Allah's Apostle would say to her, 'I have accepted your
     pledge of allegiance.' He would only say that, but, by Allah he never 
     touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while
     taking the pledge of allegiance and he never took their pledge of 
     allegiance except by his words (only)."

     While I was riding a (slow) and tired camel, the Prophet passed by and

     fast as it had never been before. The Prophet then said, "Sell it to 
     me for one Uqiyya (of gold)." I said, "No." He again said, "Sell it to
     me for one Uqiyya (of gold)." I sold it and stipulated that I should 
     ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that camel to the
     Prophet and he gave me its price. I returned home but he sent for me 
     (and when I went to him) he said, "I will not take your camel. Take 
     your camel as a gift for you." (Various narrations are mentioned here 
     with slight variations in expressions relating the condition that 
     Jabir had the right to ride the sold camel up to Medina).

     said, "Speak." He (i .e. the bedouin or the other man) said, "My son 
     was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal 
     sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was 
     obligatory that my son should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I
     ransomed my son by paying one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I 
     asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me that my 
     son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and
     the wife of this (man) must be stoned to death." Allah's Apostle said,
     "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according

     you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one

     death.

<blockquote>
<p>

     Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan:
<p>

     (whose narrations attest each other)  Allah's Apostle set out at the 
     time of Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance,
     he said, "Khalid bin Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish 
     constituting the front of the army, is at a place called Al-Ghamim, so
     take the way on the right." By Allah, Khalid did not perceive the 
     arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the 
     Muslim army reached him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform 
     Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing till he reached the Thaniyya 
     (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them (i.e. 
     people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people 
     tried their best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they
     said, "Al-Qaswa' (i.e. the she-camel's name) has become stubborn! 
     Al-Qaswa' has become stubborn!" The Prophet said, "Al-Qaswa' has not 
     become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she was 
     stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant." Then he said, "By the Name 
     of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) 
     ask me anything which will respect the ordinances of Allah, I will 
     grant it to them." 
<p>

     The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet 
     changed his way till he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya
     at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little water which the people used 
     in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its 
     water and complained to Allah's Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took 
     an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in 
     that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued sprouting out till
     all the people quenched their thirst and returned with satisfaction. 
     While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza'i came 
     with some persons from his tribe Khuza'a and they were the advisers of
     Allah's Apostle who would keep no secret from him and were from the 
     people of Tihama. Budail said, "I left Kab bin Luai and 'Amir bin Luai
     residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and they had milch 
     camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war 
     against you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba." Allah's 
     Apostle said, "We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the 
     'Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened Quraish and they have suffered 
     great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with them, 
     during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the 
     people (i.e. the 'Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have 
     victory over those infidels, Quraish will have the option to embrace 
     Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at least get 
     strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah 
     in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause 
     till I get killed, but (I am sure) Allah will definitely make His 
     Cause victorious." Budail said, "I will inform them of what you have 
     said." So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, "We have come 
     from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we 
     will disclose to you if you should like." Some of the fools among 
     Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this information, but 
     the wiser among them said, "Relate what you heard him saying." Budail 
     said, "I heard him saying so-and-so," relating what the Prophet had 
     told him.
<p>

     Urwa bin Mas'ud got up and said, "O people! Aren't you the sons? They 
     said, "Yes." He added, "Am I not the father?" They said, "Yes." He 
     said, "Do you mistrust me?" They said, "No." He said, "Don't you know 
     that I invited the people of 'Ukaz for your help, and when they 
     refused I brought my relatives and children and those who obeyed me 
     (to help you)?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Well, this man (i.e. the 
     Prophet) has offered you a reasonable proposal, you'd better accept it
     and allow me to meet him." They said, "You may meet him." So, he went 
     to the Prophet and started talking to him. The Prophet told him almost
     the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, "O Muhammad! Won't you
     feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of
     anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the 
     other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) 
     by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from 
     various tribes who would run away leaving you alone." Hearing that, 
     Abu Bakr abused him and said, "Do you say we would run and leave the 
     Prophet alone?" Urwa said, "Who is that man?" They said, "He is Abu 
     Bakr." Urwa said to Abu Bakr, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were 
     it not for the favor which you did to me and which I did not 
     compensate, I would retort on you." Urwa kept on talking to the 
     Prophet and seizing the Prophet's beard as he was talking while 
     Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, 
     holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand
     towards the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with 
     the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), "Remove your hand from the 
     beard of Allah's Apostle." Urwa raised his head and asked, "Who is 
     that?" The people said, "He is Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba." Urwa said, "O 
     treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of 
     your treachery?" 
<p>

     Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. 
     He killed them and took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace
     Islam. The Prophet said (to him, "As regards your Islam, I accept it, 
     but as for the property I do not take anything of it. (As it was taken
     through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the 
     Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah's Apostle spat, the spittle would 
     fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) who 
     would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry
     his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle 
     to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would 
     lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of 
     respect. Urwa returned to his people and said, "O people! By Allah, I 
     have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I 
     have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as 
     Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the 
     spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's 
     companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them,
     they would carry out his order immediately; if he performed ablution, 
     they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, 
     they would lower their voices and would not look at his face 
     constantly out of respect." Urwa added, "No doubt, he has presented to
     you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it." A man from the 
     tribe of Bani Kinana said, "Allow me to go to him," and they allowed 
     him, and when he approached the Prophet and his companions, Allah's Ap
     le I said, "He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that respects the
     Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of 
     him." So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him
     while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, 
     "Glorified be Allah! It is not fair to prevent these people from 
     visiting the Ka'ba." When he returned to his people, he said, 'I saw 
     the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with stabs
     on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from 
     visiting the Ka'ba." Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and 
     sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. 
     When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet said, "Here is Mikraz and 
     he is a vicious man." Mikraz started talking to the Prophet and as he 
     was talking, Suhail bin Amr came. 
<p>

     When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, "Now the matter has become
     easy." Suhail said to the Prophet "Please conclude a peace treaty with
     us." So, the Prophet called the clerk and said to him, "Write: By the 
     Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful." Suhail said, 
     "As for 'Beneficent,' by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write:
     By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write previously." The Muslims 
     said, "By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the 
     most Beneficent, the most Merciful." The Prophet said, "Write: By Your
     Name O Allah." Then he dictated, "This is the peace treaty which 
     Muhammad, Allah's Apostle has concluded." Suhail said, "By Allah, if 
     we knew that you are Allah's Apostle we would not prevent you from 
     visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with you. So, write: "Muhammad 
     bin Abdullah." The Prophet said, "By Allah! I am Apostle of Allah even
     if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah." 
     (Az-Zuhri said, "The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had 
     already said that he would accept everything they would demand if it 
     respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by letting him and his 
     companions perform 'Umra.)" The Prophet said to Suhail, "On the 
     condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka'ba) so that we
     may perform Tawaf around it." Suhail said, "By Allah, we will not 
     (allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the 'Arabs to say 
     that we have yielded to you, but we will allow you next year." So, the
     Prophet got that written. 
<p>

     Then Suhail said, "We also stipulate that you should return to us 
     whoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion." The 
     Muslims said, "Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be returned 
     to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this 
     state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin 'Amr came from the valley of Mecca 
     staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail 
     said, "O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make 
     peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me." The Prophet 
     said, "The peace treaty has not been written yet." Suhail said, "I 
     will never allow you to keep him." The Prophet said, "Yes, do." He 
     said, "I won't do.: Mikraz said, "We allow you (to keep him)." Abu 
     Jandal said, "O Muslims! Will I be returned to the pagans though I 
     have come as a Muslim? Don't you see how much I have suffered?" 
<p>

     Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin
     Al-Khattab said, "I went to the Prophet and said, 'Aren't you truly 
     the Apostle of Allah?' The Prophet said, 'Yes, indeed.' I said, 'Isn't
     our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?' He said, 'Yes.' I 
     said, 'Then why should we be humble in our religion?' He said, 'I am 
     Allah's Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me 
     victorious.' I said, 'Didn't you tell us that we would go to the Ka'ba
     and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but did I tell you that 
     we would visit the Ka'ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'So you 
     will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?' " Umar further said, "I 
     went to Abu Bakr and said, 'O Abu Bakr! Isn't he truly Allah's 
     Prophet?' He replied, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in 
     our religion?' He said, 'Indeed, he is Allah's Apostle and he does not
     disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, 
     by Allah, he is on the right.' I said, 'Was he not telling us that we 
     would go to the Kaba and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but 
     did he tell you that you would go to the Ka'ba this year?' I said, 
     'No.' He said, "You will go to Ka'ba and perform Tawaf around it." 
     (Az-Zuhri said, " 'Umar said, 'I performed many good deeds as 
     expiation for the improper questions I asked them.' ") 
<p>

     When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah's Apostle 
     said to his companions, "Get up and' slaughter your sacrifices and get
     your head shaved." By Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet 
     repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and 
     went to Um Salama and told her of the people's attitudes towards him. 
     Um Salama said, "O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be 
     carried out? Go out and don't say a word to anybody till you have 
     slaughtered your sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head." 
     So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to anyone of them till he 
     did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who 
     shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, 
     slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one 
     another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing
     each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet ); and 
     Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:--
<p>

     "O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants 
     examine them . . ." (60.10)
<p>

     Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on 
     Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya 
     married the other. When the Prophet returned to Medina, Abu Basir, a 
     new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his 
     pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), "Abide by the promise you 
     gave us." So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out 
     (of the City) till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to 
     eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, "By 
     Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword." The other drew it 
     out (of the scabbard) and said, "By Allah, it is very fine and I have 
     tried it many times." Abu Bair said, "Let me have a look at it." 
<p>

     When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and 
     his companion ran away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque 
     running. When Allah's Apostle saw him he said, "This man appears to 
     have been frightened." When he reached the Prophet he said, "My 
     companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too." Abu 
     Basir came and said, "O Allah's Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you 
     fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the 
     Infidels), but Allah has saved me from them." The Prophet said, "Woe 
     to his mother! what excellent war kindler he would be, should he only 
     have supporters." When Abu Basir heard that he understood that the 
     Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached 
     the seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them 
     (i.e. infidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish 
     embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong 
     group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish 
     heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them 
     (i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent 
     a message to the Prophet requesting him for the Sake of Allah and Kith
     and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions) promising that
     whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the 
     Prophet sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir's companions) and Allah I 
     revealed the following Divine Verses:
<p>

     "And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands 
     From them in the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over
     them. . . . the unbelievers had pride and haughtiness, in their hearts
     . . . the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance."  (48.24-26)
      And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess (write 
     in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and 
     refused to write: "In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most
     Merciful," and prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka'ba.
<p>

     Narrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, "Aisha told me that Allah's Apostle used
     to examine the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah
     revealed the order that the Muslims should return to the pagans what 
     they had spent on their wives who emigrated (after embracing Islam) 
     and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their 
     wives, 'Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu 
     Urhaiya and the daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza'i. Later on Mu'awlya 
     married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the other."
<p>

     When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their 
     wives, Allah revealed: "And if any of your wives have gone from you to
     the unbelievers and you have an accession (By the coming over of a 
     woman from the other side) (Then pay to those whose wives have gone) 
     The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr)." (60.11)
<p>

     So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be 
     given, as a compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from 
     the Mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated deserting their 
     husbands.
<p>

     We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after 
     embracing it. We have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid 
     Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim emigrant during the truce.
     Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to return Abu
     Basir.
