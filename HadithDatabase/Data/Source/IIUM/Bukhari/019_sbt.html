<p>

     Narrated 'Abdullah bin Masud :
<p>

     The Prophet recited Suratan-Najm (103) at Mecca and prostrated while 
     reciting it and those who were with him did the same except an old man
     who took a handful of small stones or earth and lifted it to his 
     forehead and said, "This is sufficient for me." Later on, I saw him 
     killed as a non-believer.

     Narrated Rabi'a:
<p>

     'Umar bin Al-Khattab recited Surat-an-Nahl on a Friday on the pulpit 
     and when he reached the verse of Sajda he got down from the pulpit and
     prostrated and the people also prostrated. The next Friday 'Umar bin 
     Al-Khattab recited the same Sura and when he reached the verse of 
     Sajda he said, "O people! When we recite the verses of Sajda (during 
     the sermon) whoever prostrates does the right thing, yet it is no sin 
     for the one who does not prostrate." And 'Umar did not prostrate (that
     day). Added Ibn 'Umar "Allah has not made the prostration of 
     recitation compulsory but if we wish we can do it."
