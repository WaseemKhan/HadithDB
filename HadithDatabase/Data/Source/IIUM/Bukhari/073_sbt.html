     I heard Abi Amr 'Ash-Shaibani saying, "The owner of this house." he 
     pointed to 'Abdullah's house, "said, 'I asked the Prophet 'Which deed 
     is loved most by Allah?" He replied, 'To offer prayers at their early 
     (very first) stated times.' " 'Abdullah asked, "What is the next (in 
     goodness)?" The Prophet said, "To be good and dutiful to one's 
     parents," 'Abdullah asked, "What is the next (in goodness)?" The 
     Prophet said, To participate in Jihad for Allah's Cause." 'Abdullah 
     added, "The Prophet narrated to me these three things, and if I had 
     asked more, he would have told me more."

     Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "While three persons were traveling, they were 
     overtaken by rain and they took shelter in a cave in a mountain. A big
     rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the cave and blocked it.
     They said to each other. 'Think of such good (righteous) deeds which, 
     you did for Allah's sake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to
     those deeds so that Allah may relieve you from your difficulty. one of
     them said, 'O Allah! I had my parents who were very old and I had 
     small children for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I 
     returned to them at night and milked (the sheep), I used to start 
     giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children. And 
     one day I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), 
     and didn't return home till late at night and found that my parents 
     had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk 
     vessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from 
     their sleep, and I also disliked to give the milk to my children 
     before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my 
     feet. 
<p>

     So this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O 
     Allah!) If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your 
     pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can see
     the sky.' So Allah made for them an opening through which they could 
     see the sky. Then the second person said, 'O Allah! I had a she-cousin
     whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a woman. I tried to 
     seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I 
     worked hard till I collected one hundred Dinars and went to her with 
     that But when I sat in between her legs (to have sexual intercourse 
     with her), she said, 'O Allah's slave! Be afraid of Allah ! Do not 
     deflower me except legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O 
     Allah! If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your 
     pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) 
     opening.' 
<p>

     So Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the
     last (third) person said 'O Allah ! I employed a laborer for wages 
     equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had finished
     his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he
     gave it up and refused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for
     him (several times) till managed to buy with the price of the yield, 
     some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. 
     '(O Allah's slave!) Be afraid o Allah, and do not be unjust to me an 
     give me my due.' I said (to him). 'Go and take those cows and their 
     shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You 
     considered that I had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please
     remove the remaining part of the rock.' And so Allah released them 
     (from their difficulty)."

<p>

     (who was one of the companions who gave the pledge of allegiance to 
     the Prophet underneath the tree (Al-Hudaibiya)) Allah's Apostle said, 
     "Whoever swears by a religion other than Islam (i.e. if somebody 
     swears by saying that he is a non-Muslim e.g., a Jew or a Christian, 
     etc.) in case he is telling a lie, he is really so if his oath is 
     false, and a person is not bound to fulfill a vow about a thing which 
     he does not possess. And if somebody commits suicide with anything in 
     this world, he will be tortured with that very thing on the Day of 
     Resurrection; And if somebody curses a believer, then his sin will be 
     as if he murdered him; And whoever accuses a believer of Kufr 
     (disbelief), then it is as if he killed him."

     her incompetent to dispose of her wealth." I said, "Did he ('Abdullah

     of anyone for him, and will not commit a sin by breaking my vow." When

     screened place and got hold of 'Aisha and started requesting her to 
     excuse him, and wept. Al-Miswar and 'Abdur Rahman also started 
     requesting her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. They said

     speaking to your Muslim Brethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim 
     not to talk to his brother for more than three nights (days)." So when
     they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good 
     relation with Kith and kin, and of excusing others' sins), and brought
     her down to a critical situation, she started reminding them, and 
     wept, saying, "I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a 
     difficult one." They (Al-Miswar and 'Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their 
     appeal till she spoke with 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and she manumitted 
     forty slaves as an expiation for her vow. Later on, whenever she

     reached (the people of) Khaibar and besieged them till we were 
     stricken with severe hunger but Allah helped the Muslims conquer 
     Khaibar. In the evening of its conquest the people made many fires. 
     Allah's Apostle asked, "What are those fires? For what are you making 
     fires?" They said, "For cooking meat." He asked, "What kind of meat?" 
     They said, "Donkeys' meat." Allah's Apostle said, "Throw away the meat
     and break the cooking pots." A man said, O Allah's Apostle! Shall we 
     throw away the meat and wash the cooking pots?" He said, "You can do 
     that too." When the army files aligned in rows (for the battle), 
     'Amir's sword was a short one, and while attacking a Jew with it in 
     order to hit him, the sharp edge of the sword turned back and hit 
     'Amir's knee and caused him to die. 
<p>

     When the Muslims returned (from the battle), Salama said, Allah's 
     Apostle saw me pale and said, 'What is wrong with you?"' I said, "Let 
     my parents be sacrificed for you! The people claim that all the deeds 
     of Amir have been annulled." The Prophet asked, "Who said so?" I 
     replied, "So-and-so and so-and-so and Usaid bin Al-Hudair Al-Ansari 
     said, 'Whoever says so is telling a lie. Verily, 'Amir will have 
     double reward."' (While speaking) the Prophet put two of his fingers 
     together to indicate that, and added, "He was really a hard-working 
     man and a Mujahid (devout fighter in Allah's Cause) and rarely have 
     there lived in it (i.e., Medina or the battle-field) an "Arab like 
     him."

     believe in Allah and all His Apostles," and then said to Ibn Saiyad, 
     "What do you see?" Ibn Saiyad said, "True people and liars visit me." 
     The Prophet said, "You have been confused as to this matter." Allah's

     Saiyad said, "Ad-Dukh." The Prophet said, "Ikhsa (you should be

     Prophet said, "If his mother had kept quiet, then I would have learnt 
     more about him." 'Abdullah added: Allah's Apostle stood up before the 
     people (delivering a sermon), and after praising and glorifying Allah 
     as He deserved, he mentioned the Ad-Dajjal saying, "I warn you against
     him, and there has been no prophet but warned his followers against 
     him. Noah warned his followers against him but I am telling you about

<p>

     That Allah's Apostle rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya 
     (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa'd 
     bin 'Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin 
     Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They 
     proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which 'Abdullah bin Ubai 
     bin Salul was present., and that was before 'Abdullah bin Ubat 
     embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators 
     and Jews, and among the Muslims there was 'Abdullah bin Rawaha. 
<p>

     When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered 
     that gathering, 'Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment 
     and said, "Do not cover us with dust." Allah's Apostle greeted them, 
     stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) 
     and recited to them the Holy Qur'an. On that 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin 
     Salul said to him, "O man! There is nothing better than what you say, 
     if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, 
     but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him." On that 
     'Abdullah bin Rawaha said "Yes, O Allah's Apostle! Call on us in our 
     gathering, for we love that." So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews 
     started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one 
     another. Allah's Apostle kept on quietening them till all of them 
     became quiet, and then Allah's Apostle rode his animal and proceeded 
     till he entered upon Sa'd bin 'Ubada. Allah's Apostle said, "O Sa'd! 
     Didn't you hear what Abu Habab said?" (meaning 'Abdullah bin Unbar). 
     "He said so-and-so." Sa'd bin Ubada said, "O Allah's Apostle! Let my 
     father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who 
     revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the Truth which was revealed to 
     you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him 
     ('Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler. 
<p>

     So when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he 
     was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite 
     manner which you had noticed." So Allah's Apostle excused him. (It was
     the custom of) Allah's Apostle and his companions to excuse the pagans
     and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered
     them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Allah said: 
     'You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who 
     received the Scripture before you.....and from the pagans (3.186)
<p>

     He also said: 'Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they 
     could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. .... 
     (2.109) So Allah's Apostle used to apply what Allah had ordered him by
     excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah's 
     Apostle had fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed whomever He 
     killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and
     Allah's Apostle and his companions had returned with victory and 
     booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the 
     nobles of the Quraish as captives. 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul and 
     the pagan idolators who were with him, said, "This matter (Islam) has 
     now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Allah's Apostle the 
     pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)". Then they became 
     Muslims.

     depend upon it?" He said: carry on doing (good) deeds, for everybody 
     will find easy such deeds as will lead him to his destined place. He 
     then recited: "As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to
     Allah.." (92.5)

<p>

     (One night) the Prophet woke up and said, "Subhan Allah ! How many 
     treasures have been (disclosed) sent down! And how many afflictions 
     have been descended! Who will go and wake the sleeping lady-occupants 
     up of these dwellings (for praying)?" (He meant by this his wives.) 
     The Prophet added, "A well-dressed soul (person) in this world may be 
     naked in the "Hereafter." 'Umar said, "I asked the Prophet, 'Have you 
     divorced your wives?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Allahu Akbar.' "

     Narrated Safiya bint Huyai:
<p>

     The wife of the Prophet that she went to Allah's Apostle while he was 
     in Itikaf (staying in the mosque) during the last ten nights of the 
     month of Ramadan. She spoke to him for an hour (a while) at night and 
     then she got up to return home. The Prophet got up to accompany her, 
     and when they reached the gate of the mosque opposite the dwelling 
     place of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by,
     and greeting Allah's Apostle , they quickly went ahead. Allah's 
     Apostle said to them, "Do not be in a hurry She is Safiya, the 
     daughter of Huyai." They said, "Subhan Allah! O Allah's Apostle (how 
     dare we suspect you)." That was a great thing for both of them. The 
     Prophet then said, "Satan runs in the body of Adam's son (i.e. man) as
     his blood circulates in it, and I was afraid that he (Satan) might 
     insert an evil thought in your hearts."
