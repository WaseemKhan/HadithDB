     Narrated Abi Huraira:
<p>

     The Prophet used to invoke Allah in his prayer, "O Allah! Save 'Aiyash
     bin Abi Rabi'a and Salama bin Hisham and Al-Walid bin Al-Walid; O 
     Allah! Save the weak among the believers; O Allah! Be hard upon the 
     tribe of Mudar and inflict years (of famine) upon them like the 
     (famine) years of Joseph."

     Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever possesses the (following) three 
     qualities will have the sweetness of faith (1): The one to whom Allah 
     and His Apostle becomes dearer than anything else; (2) Who loves a 
     person and he loves him only for Allah's Sake; (3) who hates to revert
     to atheism (disbelief) as he hates to be thrown into the Fire."

     I heard Sa'id bin Zaid saying, "I have seen myself tied and forced by 
     'Umar to leave Islam (Before 'Umar himself embraced Islam). And if the
     mountain of Uhud were to collapse for the evil which you people had 
     done to 'Uthman, then Uhud would have the right to do so." (See

     Narrated Khabbab bin Al-Art:
<p>

     We complained to Allah's Apostle (about our state) while he was 
     leaning against his sheet cloak in the shade of the Ka'ba. We said, 
     "Will you ask Allah to help us? Will you invoke Allah for us?" He 
     said, "Among those who were before you a (believer) used to be seized 
     and, a pit used to be dug for him and then he used to be placed in it.
     Then a saw used to be brought and put on his head which would be split
     into two halves. His flesh might be combed with iron combs and removed
     from his bones, yet, all that did not cause him to revert from his 
     religion. By Allah! This religion (Islam) will be completed (and 
     triumph) till a rider (traveler) goes from San'a' (the capital of 
     Yemen) to Hadramout fearing nobody except Allah and the wolf lest it 
     should trouble his sheep, but you are impatient." (See 
     Hadith No. 191, Vol. 5)

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     While we were in the mosque, Allah's Apostle came out to us and said, 
     "Let us proceed to the Jews." So we went along with him till we 
     reached Bait-al-Midras (a place where the Torah used to be recited and
     all the Jews of the town used to gather). The Prophet stood up and 
     addressed them, "O Assembly of Jews! Embrace Islam and you will be 
     safe!" The Jews replied, "O Aba-l-Qasim! You have conveyed Allah's 
     message to us." The Prophet said, "That is what I want (from you)." He
     repeated his first statement for the second time, and they said, "You 
     have conveyed Allah's message, O Aba-l-Qasim." Then he said it for the
     third time and added, "You should Know that the earth belongs to Allah
     and His Apostle, and I want to exile you fro,,, this land, so whoever 
     among you owns some property, can sell it, otherwise you should know 
     that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle." (See 
     Hadith No. 392, Vol. 4)

     and he declared that marriage invalid. (See Hadith No. 69, Vol. 7)

     I asked the Prophet, "O Allah's Apostle! Should the women be asked for
     their consent to their marriage?" He said, "Yes." I said, "A virgin, 
     if asked, feels shy and keeps quiet." He said, "Her silence means her 
     consent."

     A man from the Ansar made his slave, a Mudabbar. And apart from that

     (Egyptian) slave who died that year.
