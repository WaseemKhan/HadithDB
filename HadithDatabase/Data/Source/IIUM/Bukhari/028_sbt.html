     Narrated Nafi:
<p>

     When Abdullah bin Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at
     the time of afflictions, he said, "If I should be prevented from 
     reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Allah's Apostle did, so
     I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah's Apostle assumed the Ihram for 
     Umra in the year of Hudaibiya."

     Narrated Nafi:
<p>

     That Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah and Salim bin 'Abdullah informed him 
     that they told Ibn 'Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, 
     saying "There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this 
     year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba."
     Ibn 'Umar said "We set out with Allah's Apostle and the non-believers 
     of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka'ba, and so the Prophet 
     slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved." Ibn 'Umar added, "I 
     make you witnesses that I have made 'Umra obligatory for me. And, 
     Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka'ba is clear, I will
     perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka'ba then 
     I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company." Ibn
     'Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for 
     a while and said, "The conditions of 'Umra and Hajj are similar and I 
     make you witnesses that I have made 'Umra and Hajj obligatory for 
     myself." So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr 
     (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, "I 
     will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the 
     day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both 'Umra and 
     Hajj)."

     prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the 
     Ka'ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and 
     everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during
     the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he
     should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi."

     When Abdullah bin 'Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions 
     performing 'Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, "If I should 
     be prevented from reaching the Ka'ba, then I would do the same as we 
     did while in the company of Allah's Apostle ." So, he assumed the 
     Ihram for 'Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for 'Umra in 
     the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then 'Abdullah bin 'Umar thought about it 
     and said, "The conditions for both Hajj and 'Umra are similar." He 
     then turned towards his companions and said, "The conditions of both 
     Hajj and 'Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made 
     the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with 'Umra." He 
     then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of 
     them (i.e. Hajj and ('Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for 
     him and offered a Hadi.

     also for you in general. I was carried to Allah's Apostle and the lice
     were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, "I have
