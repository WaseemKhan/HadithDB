     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     I heard Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) saying, "We (Muslims) are the last 
     (to come) but (will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection though
     the former nations were given the Holy Scriptures before us. And this 
     was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory 
     for them but they differed about it. So Allah gave us the guidance for
     it (Friday) and all the other people are behind us in this respect: 
     the Jews' (holy day is) tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) and the Christians' 
     (is) the day after tomorrow (i.e. Sunday)."

     like the bath of Janaba and then goes for the prayer (in the first

     sacrificed a cow; and whoever goes in the third hour, then it is as if
     he had sacrificed a horned ram; and if one goes in the fourth hour, 
     then it is as if he had sacrificed a hen; and whoever goes in the 
     fifth hour then it is as if he had offered an egg. When the Imam comes
     out (i.e. starts delivering the Khutba), the angels present themselves

<p>

     Some people went to Sahl bin Sad As-Sa'idi and told him that they had 
     different opinions regarding the wood of the pulpit. They asked him 
     about it and he said, "By Allah, I know of what wood the pulpit was 
     made, and no doubt I saw it on thy very first day when Allah's Apostle
     I took his seat on it. Allah's Apostle sent for such and such an 
     Ansari woman (and Sahl mentioned her name) and said to her, 'Order 
     your slave-carpenter to prepare for me some pieces of wood (i.e. 
     pulpit) on which I may sit at the time of addressing the people.' So 
     she ordered her slave-carpenter and he made it from the tamarisk of 
     the forest and brought it (to the woman). The woman sent that (pulpit)
     to Allah's Apostle who ordered it to be placed here. Then I saw 
     Allah's Apostle praying on it and then bowed on it. Then he stepped 
     back, got down and prostrated on the ground near the foot of the 
     pulpit and again ascended the pulpit. After finishing the prayer he 
     faced the people and said, 'I have done this so that you may follow me
     and learn the way I pray.' "
