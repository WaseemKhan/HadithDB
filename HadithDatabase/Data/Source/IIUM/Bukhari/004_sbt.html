     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "The prayer of a person who does ,Hadath 
     (passes, urine, stool or wind) is not accepted till he performs 
     (repeats) the ablution." A person from Hadaramout asked Abu Huraira, 
     "What is 'Hadath'?" Abu Huraira replied, " 'Hadath' means the passing 
     of wind from the anus."

<p>

     Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet slept till he snored and then prayed (or
     probably lay till his breath sounds were heard and then got up and 
     prayed)." Ibn 'Abbas added: "I stayed overnight in the house of my 
     aunt, Maimuna, the Prophet slept for a part of the night, (See 
     Fateh-al-Bari page 249, Vol. 1), and late in the night, he got up and 
     performed ablution from a hanging water skin, a light (perfect) 
     ablution and stood up for the prayer. I, too, performed a similar 
     ablution, then I went and stood on his left. He drew me to his right 
     and prayed as much as Allah wished, and again lay and slept till his 
     breath sounds were heard. Later on the Mua'dhdhin (callmaker for the 
     prayer) came to him and informed him that it was time for Prayer. The 
     Prophet went with him for the prayer without performing a new 
     ablution." (Sufyan said to 'Amr that some people said, "The eyes of 
     Allah's Apostle sleep but his heart does not sleep." 'Amr replied, "I 
     heard 'Ubaid bin 'Umar saying that the dreams of Prophets were Divine 
     Inspiration, and then he recited the verse: 'I (Abraham) see in a 
     dream, (O my son) that I offer you in sacrifice (to Allah)." (37.102)

<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "If anyone of you feels drowsy while praying he 
     should go to bed (sleep) till his slumber is over because in praying 
     while drowsy one does not know whether one is asking for forgiveness 
     or for a bad thing for oneself."

     Once the Prophet was offering prayers at the Ka'ba. Abu Jahl was

     "Who amongst you will bring the abdominal contents (intestines, etc.) 
     of a camel of Bani so and so and put it on the back of Muhammad, when 
     he prostrates?" The most unfortunate of them got up and brought it. He
     waited till the Prophet prostrated and then placed it on his back 
     between his shoulders. I was watching but could not do any thing. I 
     wish I had some people with me to hold out against them. They started 
     laughing and falling on one another. Allah's Apostle was in 
     prostration and he did not lift his head up till Fatima (Prophet's 
     daughter) came and threw that (camel's abdominal contents) away from 
     his back. He raised his head and said thrice, "O Allah! Punish 
     Quraish." So it was hard for Abu Jahl and his companions when the 
     Prophet invoked Allah against them as they had a conviction that the 
     prayers and invocations were accepted in this city (Mecca). The 
     Prophet said, "O Allah! Punish Abu Jahl, 'Utba bin Rabi'a, Shaiba bin 
     Rabi'a, Al-Walid bin 'Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, and 'Uqba bin Al Mu'it
