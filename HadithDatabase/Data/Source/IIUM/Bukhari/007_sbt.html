<p>

     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     (the wife of the Prophet) We set out with Allahs Apostle on one of his
     journeys till we reached Al-Baida' or Dhatul-Jaish, a necklace of mine
     was broken (and lost). Allah's Apostle stayed there to search for it, 
     and so did the people along with him. There was no water at that 
     place, so the people went to Abu- Bakr As-Siddiq and said, "Don't you 
     see what 'Aisha has done? She has made Allah's Apostle and the people 
     stay where there is no water and they have no water with them." Abu 
     Bakr came while Allah's Apostle was sleeping with his head on my 
     thigh, He said, to me: "You have detained Allah's Apostle and the 
     people where there is no water and they have no water with them.
<p>

     So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say and hit me 
     on my flank with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because 
     of pain) but the position of Allah's Apostle on my thigh. Allah's 
     Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah 
     revealed the Divine Verses of Tayammum. So they all performed 
     Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, "O the family of Abu Bakr! This is 
     not the first blessing of yours." Then the camel on which I was riding
     was caused to move from its place and the necklace was found beneath 
     it.

     Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:
<p>

     The Prophet said, "I have been given five things which were not given 
     to any one else before me.
<p>

     1. Allah made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) 
     for a distance of one month's journey.
<p>

     2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for 
     praying and a thing to perform Tayammum, therefore anyone of my 
     followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.
<p>

     3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me yet it was not lawful
     for anyone else before me.
<p>

     4. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of 
     Resurrection).
<p>

     5. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only but I have been 
     sent to all mankind.

<p>

     Aisha said, "I borrowed a necklace from Asma' and it was lost. So 
     Allah's Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the 
     time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed 
     (without ablution) and informed Allah's Apostle about it, so the verse
     of Tayammum was revealed." Usaid bin Hudair said to 'Aisha, "May Allah
     reward you. By Allah, whenever anything happened which you did not 
     like, Allah brought good for you and for the Muslims in that."
<p>

     Al-Jurf and the time for the 'Asr prayer became due while he was at 
     Marbad-AnNa'am (sheep-fold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed 
     there and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did 
     not repeat that prayer.

<p>

     Narrated 'Imran:
<p>

     Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling 
     till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and 
     slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in 
     the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that 
     made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and
     so and then so and so (the narrator 'Auf said that Abu Raja' had told 
     him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to 
     wake up was 'Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to 
     sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we 
     did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. 
     So, 'Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a 
     strict man, so he said, "Allahu Akbar" and raised his voice with 
     Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of 
     it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to
     them. He said, "There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!"
     So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the
     Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So 
     he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced 
     and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he
     saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, 
     "O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?" He 
     replied, "I am Junub and there is no water. " The Prophet said, 
     "Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you."
<p>

     Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of 
     thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator 'Auf 
     added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and 'Ali, and
     ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water 
     and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of 
     water. They asked, "Where can we find water?" She replied, "I was 
     there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are 
     behind me." They requested her to accompany them. She asked, "Where?" 
     They said, "To Allah's Apostle ." She said, "Do you mean the man who 
     is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?" They replied, "Yes, the 
     same person. So come along." They brought her to the Prophet and 
     narrated the whole story. He said, "Help her to dismount." The Prophet
     asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some
     water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and 
     opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and 
     water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) 
     all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of 
     all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub 
     and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and 
     watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when
     her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full
     (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah's Apostle) Then
     the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour 
     and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in
     a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth 
     full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the 
     Prophet said to her, "We have not taken your water but Allah has given
     water to us." She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: "O so 
     and so what has delayed you?" She said, "A strange thing! Two men met 
     me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi' and he did such and 
     such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between 
     this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising 
     them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is 
     Allah's true Apostle."
<p>

     Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but 
     never touched her village. One day she said to her people, "I think 
     that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to
     Islam?" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.
<p>

     Abu 'Abdultah said: The word Saba'a means "The one who has deserted 
     his old religion and embraced a new religion." Abul 'Ailya said, "The 
     Sabis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of 
     Psalms."

     Narrated Al-A'mash:
<p>

     Shaqiq said, "While I was sitting with 'Abdullah and Abu Musa 
     Al-Ash-'ari, the latter asked the former, 'If a person becomes Junub 
     and does not find water for one month, can he perform Tayammum and 
     offer his prayer?' (He applied in the negative). Abu Musa said, 'What 
     do you say about this verse from Surat "Al-Ma'ida": When you do not 
     find water then perform Tayammum with clean earth? 'Abdullah replied, 
     'If we allowed it then they would probably perform Tayammum with clean
     earth even if water were available but cold.' I said to Shaqiq, 'You 
     then disliked to perform Tayammum because of this?' Shaqiq said,'Yes.'
     (Shaqiq added), "Abu Musa said, 'Haven't you heard the statement of 
     'Ammar to 'Umar? He said: I was sent out by Allah's Apostle for some 
     job and I became Junub and could not find water so I rolled myself 
     over the dust (clean earth) like an animal does, and when I told the 
     Prophet of that he said, 'Like this would have been sufficient.' The 
     Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and 
     blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right 
     hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then 
     passed them over his face.' So 'Abdullah said to Abu- Musa, 'Don't you
     know that 'Umar was not satisfied with 'Ammar's statement?' "
<p>

     Narrated Shaqiq: While I was with 'Abdullah and Abu Musa, the latter 
     said to the former, "Haven't you heard the statement of 'Ammar to 
     'Umar? He said, "Allah's Apostle sent you and me out and I became 
     Junub and rolled myself in the dust (clean earth) (for Tayammum). When
     we came to Allah's Apostle I told him about it and he said, 'This 
     would have been sufficient,' passing his hands over his face and the 
     backs of his hands once only.' "
