     by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of good smelling grass). Would that 
     one day I would drink of the water of Majinna and would that Shama and

     The Prophet rode a donkey having a saddle with a Fadakiyya velvet

     and that had been before the battle of Badr. The Prophet proceeded 
     till he passed by a gathering in which 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul 
     was present, and that had been before 'Abdullah embraced Islam. The 
     gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e., isolators and Jews.
     'Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust 
     raised by the donkey covered the gathering, 'Abdullah bin Ubai covered
     his nose with his upper garment and said, "Do not trouble us with 
     dust." The Prophet greeted them, stopped and dismounted. Then he 
     invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them 
     some verses of the Holy Qur'an. On that, 'Abdullah bin Ubai said, "O 
     man ! There is nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not 
     trouble us with it in our gathering, but return to your house, and if 
     somebody comes to you, teach him there." On that 'Abdullah bin Rawaha 
     said, Yes, O Allah's Apostle! Bring your teachings to our gathering, 
     for we love that." So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started 
     abusing each other till they were about to fight. The Prophet kept on 
     quietening them till they became calm. Thereupon the Prophet mounted 
     his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. He said 
     to him "O Sad! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e., 'Abdullah bin 
     Ubai) said?" Sad said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for
     Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town 
     (Medina decided unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by 
     placing a turban on his head, but when that was prevented by the Truth
     which Allah had given you he ('Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved out of

     Whenever Allah's Apostle paid a visit to a patient, or a patient was 
     brought to him, he used to invoke Allah, saying, "Take away the 
     disease, O the Lord of the people! Cure him as You are the One Who 
     cures. There is no cure but Yours, a cure that leaves no disease."

     The Prophet came to me while I was ill. He performed ablution and 
     threw the remaining water on me (or said, "Pour it on him) " When I 
     came to my senses I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have no son or father 
     to be my heir, so how will be my inheritance?" Then the Verse of 
     inheritance was revealed.

     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     When Allah's Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal had a 
     fever. I entered upon them and said, "O my father! How are you? O 
     Bilal! How are you?" Whenever Abu Bakr got the fever he used to say, 
     "Everybody is staying alive with his people, yet death is nearer to 
     him than his shoe laces." And when fever deserted Bilal, he would 
     recite (two poetic verses): "Would that I could stay overnight in a 
     valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds 
     of good smelling grass). Would that one day I could drink of the water
     of Majinna, and would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) 
     would appear to me!" I went to Allah's Apostle and informed him about 
     that. He said, "O Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we 
     love Mecca, and make it healthy, and bless its Sa and its Mudd, and 
     take away its fever and put it in Al-Juhfa." (See Hadith No 558) .
