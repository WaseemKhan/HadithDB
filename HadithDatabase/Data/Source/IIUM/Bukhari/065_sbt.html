     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Once while I was in a state of fatigue (because of severe hunger), I 
     met 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, so I asked him to recite a verse from 
     Allah's Book to me. He entered his house and interpreted it to me. 
     (Then I went out and) after walking for a short distance, I fell on my
     face because of fatigue and severe hunger. Suddenly I saw Allah's 
     Apostle  standing by my head. He said, "O Abu Huraira!" I replied, 
     "Labbaik, O Allah's Apostle, and Sadaik!" Then he held me by the hand,
     and made me get up. Then he came to know what I was suffering from. He
     took me to his house, and ordered a big bowl of milk for me. I drank 
     thereof and he said, "Drink more, O Abu Hirr!" So I drank again, 
     whereupon he again said, "Drink more." So I drank more till my belly 
     became full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards I met 'Umar and 
     mentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, "Somebody, 
     who had more right than you, O 'Umar, took over the case. By Allah, I 
     asked you to recite a Verse to me while I knew it better than you." On
     that Umar said to me, "By Allah, if I admitted and entertained you, it
     would have been dearer to me than having nice red camels.

     Apostle in the mosque with some people. I stood up near them, and 
     Allah's Apostle asked me, "Have you been sent by Abu Talha?" I said, 
     "Yes." He asked, "With some food (for us)?" I said, "Yes." Then 
     Allah's Apostle said to all those who were with him, "Get up!" He set 
     out (and all the people accompanied him) and I proceeded ahead of them
     till I came to Abu Talha. Abu Talha then said, "O Um Sulaim! Allah's 
     Apostle has arrived along with the people, and we do not have food 
     enough to feed them all." She said, "Allah and His Apostle know 
     better." So Abu Talha went out till he met Allah's Apostle. Then Abu 
     Talha and Allah's Apostle came and entered the house. Allah's Apostle 
     said, "Um Sulaim ! Bring whatever you have." She brought that very 
     bread. The Prophet ordered that it be crushed into small pieces, and 
     Um Sulaim pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah's Apostle said 
     whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added, 
     "Admit ten (men)." So they were admitted, ate their fill and went out.
     The Prophet then said, "Admit ten (more)." They were admitted, ate 
     their full, and went out. He then again said, "Admit ten more!" They 
     were admitted, ate their fill, and went out. He admitted ten more, and
     so all those people ate their fill, and they were eighty men.

     We were one hundred and thirty men sitting with the Prophet. The 
     Prophet said, "Have anyone of you any food with him?" It happened that
     one man had one Sa of wheat flour (or so) which was turned into dough 
     then. After a while a tall lanky pagan came, driving some sheep. The 
     Prophet asked, 'Will you sell us (a sheep), or give (it to) us as a

     from him a sheep which was slaughtered, and then the Prophet ordered

     At the time of Ibn Az-Zubair, we were struck with famine, and he 
     provided us with dates for our food. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar used to pass 
     by us while we were eating, and say, "Do not eat two dates together at
     a time, for the Prophet forbade the taking of two dates together at a 
     time (in a gathering)." Ibn 'Umar used to add, "Unless one takes the 
     permission of one's companions."

     My mother, Um Sulaim, took a Mudd of barley grain, ground it and made 
     porridge from it, and pressed (over it), a butter skin she had with 
     her. Then she sent me to the Prophet, and I reached him while he was 
     sitting with his companions. I invited him, whereupon he said, "And 
     those who are with me?' I returned and said, "He says, 'And those who 
     are with me?" Abu Talha went out to him and said, "O Allah's Apostle! 
     It is just a meal prepared by Um Sulaim." The Prophet entered and the 
     food was brought to him. He said, "Let ten persons enter upon me." 
     Those ten entered and ate their fill. Again he said, 'Let ten (more) 
     enter upon me." Those ten entered and ate their fill. Then he said, 
     "Let ten (more) enter upon me." He called forty persons in all Then 
     Allah's Apostle ate and got up. I started looking (at the food) to see
     if it decreased or not.

     reached the door of 'Aisha's room. Then he thought that the people 
     must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned 
     with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he
     went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too.
