     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     The Prophet said, "Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall. When
     He created him, He said to him, "Go and greet that group of angels, 
     and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) 
     and the greeting (salutations of your offspring." So, Adam said (to 
     the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels 
     said, "As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi" (i.e. Peace and Allah's 
     Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam's salutation the 
     expression, 'Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,' Any person who will enter Paradise 
     will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been 
     decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.

     Allah's Apostle said, "The first group of people who will enter

     follow them, will glitter like the most brilliant star in the sky. 
     They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit, or have any nasal 
     secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat will smell 
     like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives 
     will be houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their 
     father Adam (in statute), sixty cubits tall."

     Um Salama said, "Um Salaim said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah does not 
     refrain from saying the truth! Is it obligatory for a woman to take a 
     bath after she gets nocturnal discharge?' He said, 'Yes, if she 
     notices the water (i.e. discharge).' Um Salama smiled and said, 'Does 
     a woman get discharge?' Allah's Apostle said. 'Then why does a child 
     resemble (its mother)?"

     Narrated Anas:
<p>

     When 'Abdullah bin Salam heard the arrival of the Prophet at Medina, 
     he came to him and said, "I am going to ask you about three things 
     which nobody knows except a prophet: What is the first portent of the 
     Hour? What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why
     does a child resemble its father, and why does it resemble its 
     maternal uncle" Allah's Apostle said, "Gabriel has just now told me of
     their answers." 'Abdullah said, "He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all 
     the angels, is the enemy of the Jews." Allah's Apostle said, "The 
     first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the 
     people from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of 
     Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver. As for the 
     resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual 
     intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will 
     resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child 
     will resemble her." On that 'Abdullah bin Salam said, "I testify that 
     you are the Apostle of Allah." 'Abdullah bin Salam further said, "O 
     Allah's Apostle! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know 
     about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they 
     would tell a lie about me." The Jews came to Allah's Apostle and 
     'Abdullah went inside the house. Allah's Apostle asked (the Jews), 
     "What kind of man is 'Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?" They replied, 
     "He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, 
     and the son of the best amongst us." Allah's Apostle said, "What do 
     you think if he embraces Islam (will you do as he does)?" The Jews 
     said, "May Allah save him from it." Then 'Abdullah bin Salam came out 
     in front of them saying, "I testify that None has the right to be 
     worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah." 
     Thereupon they said, "He is the evilest among us, and the son of the 
     evilest amongst us," and continued talking badly of him.

     Narrated Abdullah:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle, the true and truly inspired said, "(as regards your 
     creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for
     the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for an other forty 
     days, and then a piece of flesh for an other forty days. Then Allah 
     sends an angel to write four words: He writes his deeds, time of his 
     death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be wretched or 
     blessed (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a 
     man may do deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so 
     much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it,
     and then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and so he 
     starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and enters
     Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the 
     people of Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a 
     cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the 
     angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the people of the 
     (Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire."

     the child's creation, the angel will say. 'O Lord! A male or a female?
     O Lord! wretched or blessed (in religion)? What will his livelihood 
     be? What will his age be?' The angel writes all this while the child

     We were in the company of the Prophet at a banquet and a cooked 
     (mutton) forearm was set before him, and he used to like it. He ate a 
     morsel of it and said, "I will be the chief of all the people on the 
     Day of Resurrection. Do you know how Allah will gather all the first 
     and the last (people) in one level place where an observer will be 
     able to see (all) of them and they will be able to hear the announcer,
     and the sun will come near to them. Some People will say: Don't you

     reached? Why don't you look for a person who can intercede for you 
     with your Lord? Some people will say: Appeal to your father, Adam.' 
     They will go to him and say: 'O Adam! You are the father of all 
     mankind, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the 
     angels to prostrate for you, and made you live in Paradise. Will you 
     not intercede for us with your Lord? Don't you see in what (miserable)
     state we are, and to what condition we have reached?' On that Adam 
     will reply, 'My Lord is so angry as He has never been before and will 
     never be in the future; (besides), He forbade me (to eat from) the 
     tree, but I disobeyed (Him), (I am worried about) myself! Myself! Go 
     to somebody else; go to Noah.' They will go to Noah and say; 'O Noah! 
     You are the first amongst the messengers of Allah to the people of the
     earth, and Allah named you a thankful slave. Don't you see in what a 
     (miserable) state we are and to what condition we have reached? Will

     will come to me, and I will prostrate myself underneath Allah's

     a westerly wind)." Narrated Abu Said: Ali sent a piece of gold to the 
     Prophet who distributed it among four persons: Al-Aqra' bin Habis 
     Al-Hanzali from the tribe of Mujashi, 'Uyaina bin Badr Al-Fazari, Zaid
     At-Ta'i who belonged to (the tribe of) Bani Nahban, and 'Alqama bin

     Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, "He (i.e. the Prophet, ) 
     gives the chief of Najd and does not give us." The Prophet said, "I 
     give them) so as to attract their hearts (to Islam)." Then a man with 
     sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised forehead, a thick beard and a 
     shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet ) and said, "Be afraid of 
     Allah, O Muhammad!" The Prophet ' said "Who would obey Allah if I 
     disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Allah has trusted all the people of 
     the earth to me while, you do not trust me?" Somebody who, I think was
     Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested the Prophet to let him chop that man's 
     head off, but he prevented him. When the man left, the Prophet said, 
     "Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the 
     Qur'an but the Qur'an will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they 
     will recite like parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), 
     and they will renegade from the religion as an arrow goes through the

     done this but) the big idol has done it." The (third was) that while 
     Abraham and Sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by 
     (the territory of) a tyrant. Someone said to the tyrant, "This man 
     (i.e. Abraham) is accompanied by a very charming lady." So, he sent 
     for Abraham and asked him about Sarah saying, "Who is this lady?" 
     Abraham said, "She is my sister." Abraham went to Sarah and said, "O 
     Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you 
     and I. This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my
     sister, so don't contradict my statement." The tyrant then called 
     Sarah and when she went to him, he tried to take hold of her with his 
     hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded. He asked Sarah. 
     "Pray to Allah for me, and I shall not harm you." So Sarah asked Allah
     to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the 
     second time, but (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and)
     was more confounded. He again requested Sarah, "Pray to Allah for me, 
     and I will not harm you." Sarah asked Allah again and he became 
     alright. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her) and 
     said, "You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a 
     devil." The tyrant then gave Hajar as a girl-servant to Sarah. Sarah 
     came back (to Abraham) while he was praying. Abraham, gesturing with 
     his hand, asked, "What has happened?" She replied, "Allah has spoiled 
     the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and gave me Hajar for
     service." (Abu Huraira then addressed his listeners saying, "That 
     (Hajar) was your mother, O Bani Ma-is-Sama (i.e. the Arabs, the 
     descendants of Ishmael, Hajar's son)."

<p>

     Narrated Ibn Abbas:
<p>

     The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael.  She used a 
     girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought 
     her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near 
     the Ka'ba under a tree on the spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in
     the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there
     any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a 
     leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing 
     some water, and set out homeward. Ishmael's mother followed him 
     saying, "O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley 
     where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there 
     anything (to enjoy)?" She repeated that to him many times, but he did 
     not look back at her Then she asked him, "Has Allah ordered you to do 
     so?" He said, "Yes." She said, "Then He will not neglect us," and 
     returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya 
     where they could not see him, he faced the Ka'ba, and raising both 
     hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers:
<p>

     'O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley 
     without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O 
     our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts 
     among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with 
     fruits, so that they may give thanks.'  (14.37) Ishmael's mother went 
     on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had).
<p>

     When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became 
     thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him 
     (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not 
     endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the 
     nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started 
     looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she 
     could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she 
     reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like 
     a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and 
     reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, 
     expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated
     that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times." 
<p>

     The Prophet said, "This is the source of the tradition of the walking 
     of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the 
     Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to 
     be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said,
     'O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you 
     got something to help me?" And behold! She saw an angel at the place 
     of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water 
     flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin 
     around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her 
     water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out 
     after she had scooped some of it." 
<p>

     The Prophet added, "May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmael's mother! Had 
     she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she 
     not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would 
     have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth." The Prophet 
     further added, "Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The 
     angel said to her, 'Don't be afraid of being neglected, for this is 
     the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and
     Allah never neglects His people.' The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time 
     was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they
     flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people 
     from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her
     child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of
     Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird 
     that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They 
     said, 'This bird must be flying around water, though we know that 
     there is no water in this valley.' They sent one or two messengers who
     discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the 
     water. So, they all came (towards the water)." The Prophet added, 
     "Ishmael's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, 'Do you 
     allow us to stay with you?" She replied, 'Yes, but you will have no 
     right to possess the water.' They agreed to that." The Prophet further
     said, "Ishmael's mother was pleased with the whole situation as she 
     used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled 
     there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled 
     with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The 
     child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his 
     virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he
     reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst 
     them. 
<p>

     After Ishmael's mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael's marriage
     in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not 
     find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael's wife about him, she 
     replied, 'He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Then he asked her 
     about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, 'We 
     are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,' 
     complaining to him. He said, 'When your husband returns, convey my 
     salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of
     his house).' When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something 
     unusual, so he asked his wife, 'Has anyone visited you?' She replied, 
     'Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you 
     and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told
     him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.' On that Ishmael 
     said, 'Did he advise you anything?' She replied, 'Yes, he told me to 
     convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold 
     of your gate.' Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and he has ordered me 
     to divorce you. Go back to your family.' So, Ishmael divorced her and 
     married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). 
<p>

     Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah 
     wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came 
     to Ishmael's wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, 'He has gone 
     in search of our livelihood.' Abraham asked her, 'How are you getting 
     on?' asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, 'We 
     are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).' 
     Then she thanked Allah' Abraham said, 'What kind of food do you eat?' 
     She said. 'Meat.' He said, 'What do you drink?' She said, 'Water." He 
     said, "O Allah! Bless their meat and water." The Prophet  added, "At 
     that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would 
     have also invoked Allah to bless it." The Prophet added, "If somebody 
     has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and 
     disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca." The 
     Prophet added," Then Abraham said Ishmael's wife, "When your husband 
     comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm 
     the threshold of his gate.' When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife,
     'Did anyone call on you?' She replied, 'Yes, a good-looking old man 
     came to me,' so she praised him and added. 'He asked about you, and I 
     informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we
     were in a good condition.' Ishmael asked her, 'Did he give you any 
     piece of advice?' She said, 'Yes, he told me to give his regards to 
     you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.'
     On that Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and you are the threshold (of
     the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.' 
<p>

     Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah 
     wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree 
     near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to
     welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son
     or a son does with his father). Abraham said, 'O Ishmael! Allah has 
     given me an order.' Ishmael said, 'Do what your Lord has ordered you 
     to do.' Abraham asked, 'Will you help me?' Ishmael said, 'I will help 
     you.' Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' 
     pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it." The 
     Prophet added, "Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. 
     the Ka'ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and 
     when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for 
     Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was 
     handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 'O our Lord! 
     Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the 
     All-Knowing.' The Prophet added, "Then both of them went on building 
     and going round the Ka'ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) 
     from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."   (2.127)

     Narrated Ibn Abbas:
<p>

     When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of her jealousy 
     of Hajar, Ishmael's mother), he took Ishmael and his mother and went 
     away. They had a water-skin with them containing some water, Ishmael's
     mother used to drink water from the water-skin so that her milk would 
     increase for her child. When Abraham reached Mecca, he made her sit 
     under a tree and afterwards returned home. Ishmael's mother followed 
     him, and when they reached Kada', she called him from behind, 'O 
     Abraham! To whom are you leaving us?' He replied, '(I am leaving you) 
     to Allah's (Care).' She said, 'I am satisfied to be with Allah.' She 
     returned to her place and started drinking water from the water-skin, 
     and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used
     up, she said to herself, 'I'd better go and look so that I may see 
     somebody.' She ascended the Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see 
     somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the valley, she ran till 
     she reached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two 
     mountains) many times. They she said to herself, 'i'd better go and 
     see the state of the child,' she went and found it in a state of one 
     on the point of dying. She could not endure to watch it dying and said
     (to herself), 'If I go and look, I may find somebody.' She went and 
     ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not 
     find anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of running) between 
     Safa and Marwa. Again she said (to herself), 'I'd better go back and 
     see the state of the child.' But suddenly she heard a voice, and she 
     said to that strange voice, 'Help us if you can offer any help.' Lo! 
     It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). Gabriel hit the earth with 
     his heel like this (Ibn 'Abbas hit the earth with his heel to 
     Illustrate it), and so the water gushed out. Ishmael's mother was 
     astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet) 
     said, "If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her 
     intervention), it would have been flowing on the surface of the 
     earth.") Ishmael's mother started drinking from the water and her milk
     increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe of 
     Jurhum, while passing through the bottom of the valley, saw some 
     birds, and that astonished them, and they said, 'Birds can only be 
     found at a place where there is water.' They sent a messenger who 
     searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform them 
     about it. Then they all went to her and said, 'O ishmael's mother! 
     Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell with you)?' (And thus they 
     stayed there.) Later on her boy reached the age of puberty and married
     a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham which he disclosed 
     to his wife (Sarah), 'I want to call on my dependents I left (at 
     Mecca).' When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael's wife) and said, 
     'Where is Ishmael?' She replied, 'He has gone out hunting.' Abraham 
     said (to her), 'When he comes, tell him to change the threshold of his
     gate.' When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael said to 
     her, 'You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are 
     divorced).' Again Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he 
     had left (at Mecca), and he told his wife (Sarah) of his intentions. 
     Abraham came to Ishmael's house and asked. "Where is Ishmael?" 
     Ishmael's wife replied, "He has gone out hunting," and added, "Will 
     you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?' Abraham
     asked, 'What is your food and what is your drink?' She replied, 'Our 
     food is meat and our drink is water.' He said, 'O Allah! Bless their 
     meals and their drink." Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e. Prophet) said, "Because of
     Abraham's invocation there are blessings (in Mecca)." Once more 
     Abraham thought of visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he 
     told his wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael 
     behind the Zam-zam well, mending his arrows. He said, "O Ishmael, Your
     Lord has ordered me to build a house for Him." Ishmael said, "Obey 
     (the order of) your Lord." Abraham said, "Allah has also ordered me 
     that you should help me therein." Ishmael said, "Then I will do." So, 
     both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka'ba) while 
     Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 
     "O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the 
     All-Hearing, the All-Knowing." (2.127). When the building became high 
     and the old man (i.e. Abraham) could no longer lift the stones (to 
     such a high position), he stood over the stone of Al-Maqam and Ishmael
     carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 'O 
     our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, 
     All-Knowing."  (2.127)

<p>

     I said to Ibn Abbas, "Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses, the companion 
     of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, 
     but some other Moses." Ibn 'Abbas said, "Allah's enemy (i.e. Nauf) has
     told a lie. Ubai bin Ka'b told us that the Prophet said, 'Once Moses 
     stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked who was the most 
     learned man amongst the people. He said, 'I.' Allah admonished him as 
     he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said
     to him, 'Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine
     who is more learned than you.' Moses said, 'O my Lord! How can I meet 
     him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you 
     will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.' Moses took a
     fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) 
     boy, Yusha 'bin Nun, till they reached the rock where they laid their 
     heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the 
     basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as 
     in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it 
     became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his 
     hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses 
     said to his boy (servant), 'Give us our food, for indeed, we have 
     suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.' Moses did not feel 
     tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek 
     after. His boy (servant) said to him, 'Do you know that when we were 
     sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused 
     me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the 
     sea in an amazing way?.' So there was a path for the fish and that 
     astonished them. Moses said, 'That was what we were seeking after.' 
     So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. 
     There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him 
     and he replied saying, 'How do people greet each other in your land?' 
     Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The man asked, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses
     said, 'Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those 
     things which Allah has taught you.' He said, 'O Moses! I have some of 
     the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do not
     know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has 
     taught you and which I do not know.' Moses asked, 'May I follow you?' 
     He said, 'But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how 
     can you be patient about things which you will not be able to 
     understand?' (Moses said, 'You will find me, if Allah so will, truly 
     patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.') So, both of them set 
     out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked 
     the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized 
     Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were 
     on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat 
     and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to 
     Moses, 'O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased 
     Allah's Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the 
     water of the sea with its beak.' Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze 
     and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a
     plank with the adze. Moses said to him, 'What have you done? They took
     us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have intentionally made a 
     hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have 
     done a dreadful thing.' Al-Khadir replied, 'Did I not tell you that 
     you would not be able to remain patient with me?' Moses replied, 'Do 
     not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard upon me for
     my fault.' So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. 
     When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other 
     boys.
<p>

     Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like
     this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he 
     was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, "Have you killed an 
     innocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a 
     horrible thing." Al-Khadir said, "Did I not tell you that you could 
     not remain patient with me?' Moses said "If I ask you about anything 
     after this, don't accompany me. You have received an excuse from me.' 
     Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, 
     and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain 
     them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to 
     collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his 
     hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands, 
     illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) 
     Moses said, "These are the people whom we have called on, but they 
     neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet you have 
     repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for
     it." Al-Khadir said, "This is the parting between you and me, and I 
     shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not 
     remain patient." The Prophet added, "We wished that Moses could have 
     remained patient by virtue of which Allah might have told us more 
     about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet 
     said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained 
     patient, we would have been told further about their case.")

     Allah's Apostle said, "(The Prophet) Moses was a shy person and used 
     to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness. One of 
     the children of Israel hurt him by saying, 'He covers his body in this
     way only because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal
     hernia, or he has some other defect.' Allah wished to clear Moses of 
     what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in seclusion, he 
     took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a 
     bath. When he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so 
     as to take them, but the stone took his clothes and fled; Moses picked
     up his stick and ran after the stone saying, 'O stone! Give me my 
     garment!' Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked 
     then, and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah 
     cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone stopped there 
     and Moses took and put his garment on and started hitting the stone 
     with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the 
     hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in 
     His Saying:-- "O you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed 
     Moses, But Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged, And 
     he was honorable In Allah's Sight." (33.69)

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     The Prophet said, "None spoke in cradle but three: (The first was) 
     Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. 
     While he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He 
     said (to himself), 'Shall I answer her or keep on praying?" (He went 
     on praying) and did not answer her, his mother said, "O Allah! Do not 
     let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes." So while he was in
     his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. 
     So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit 
     illegal sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a
     child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, 
     came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it 
     and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer, and 
     then came to the child and said, 'O child! Who is your father?' The 
     child replied, 'The shepherd.' (After hearing this) the people said, 
     'We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,' but he said, 'No, of 
     nothing but mud.'(The third was the hero of the following story) A 
     lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a 
     handsome rider passed by her. She said, 'O Allah ! Make my child like 
     him.' On that the child left her breast, and facing the rider said, 'O
     Allah! Do not make me like him.' The child then started to suck her 
     breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, "As if I were now looking at 
     the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.") After a 
     while the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the 
     child's mother) said, 'O Allah! Do not make my child like this (slave 
     girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said, 'O Allah! Make me 
     like her.' When she asked why, the child replied, 'The rider is one of
     the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and 
     illegal sexual intercourse."
