     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "When an adulterer commits illegal sexual 
     intercourse, then he is not a believer at the time he is doing it; and
     when somebody drinks an alcoholic drink, then he is not believer at 
     the time of drinking, and when a thief steals, he is not a believer at
     the time when he is stealing; and when a robber robs and the people 
     look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing it." Abu 
     Huraira in another narration, narrated the same from the Prophet with 
     the exclusion of robbery.
