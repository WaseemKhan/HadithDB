     Allah), and I want to keep such an invocation for interceding for my

     The Prophet said "The most superior way of asking for forgiveness from
     Allah is: 'Allahumma anta Rabbi la ilaha illa anta, Anta Khalaqtani wa
     ana abduka, wa ana 'ala ahdika wa wa'dika mastata'tu, A'udhu bika min

     bidhanbi faghfirli innahu la yaghfiru adhdhunuba illa anta."  The 
     Prophet added. "If somebody recites it during the day with firm faith 
     in it, and dies on the same day before the evening, he will be from 
     the people of Paradise; and if somebody recites it at night with firm 
     faith in it, and dies before the morning, he will be from the people 
     of Paradise."

     Narrated Al-Harith bin Suwaid:
<p>

     'Abdullah bin Mas'ud related to us two narrations: One from the 
     Prophet and the other from himself, saying: A believer sees his sins 
     as if he were sitting under a mountain which, he is afraid, may fall 
     on him; whereas the wicked person considers his sins as flies passing 
     over his nose and he just drives them away like this." Abu Shihab (the
     sub-narrator) moved his hand over his nose in illustration. (Ibn 
     Mas'ud added): Allah's Apostle said, "Allah is more pleased with the 
     repentance of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his 
     life is jeopardized, but he has his riding beast carrying his food and
     water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a short while and wakes 
     to find his riding beast gone. (He starts looking for it) and suffers 
     from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished (him to suffer from).
     He then says, 'I will go back to my place.' He returns and sleeps 
     again, and then (getting up), he raises his head to find his riding 
     beast standing beside him."

     this) you will die on the religion of Islam (i.e., as a Muslim); so 
     let these words be the last you say (before going to bed)" While I was
     memorizing it, I said, "Wa birasiulikal-ladhi arsalta (in Your Apostle
     whom You have sent).' The Prophet said, "No, but say: Wa

     Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:
<p>

     One night I slept at the house of Maimuna. The Prophet woke up, 
     answered the call of nature, washed his face and hands, and then 
     slept. He got up (late at night), went to a water skin, opened the 
     mouth thereof and performed ablution not using much water, yet he 
     washed al I the parts properly and then offered the prayer. I got up 
     and straightened my back in order that the Prophet might not feel that
     I was watching him, and then I performed the ablution, and when he got
     up to offer the prayer, stood on his left. He caught hold of my ear 
     and brought me over to his right side. He offered thirteen Rak'at in 
     all and then lay down and slept till he started blowing out his breath
     as he used to do when he slept. In the meantime Bilal informed the 
     Prophet of the approaching time for the (Fajr) prayer, and the Prophet
     offered the Fajr (Morning) prayer without performing new ablution. He 
     used to say in his invocation, Allaihumma ij'al fi qalbi nuran wa fi 
     basari nuran, wa fi sam'i nuran, wa'an yamini nuran, wa'an yasari 
     nuran, wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi 
     nuran, waj'al li nuran."  Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, "I have 
     forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet mentioned in this 
     invocation). I met a man from the offspring of Al-'Abbas and he 
     narrated those seven things to me, mentioning, '(Let there be light 
     in) my nerves, my flesh, my blood, my hair and my body,' and he also 
     mentioned two other things."

     'Aisha informed him about it. Ali added: The Prophet came to us when 
     we had gone to our beds. When I was going to get up, he said, "'Stay 
     in your places," and sat between us, till I felt the coolness of the 
     feet on my chest. The Prophet then said, "Shall I not tell you of a 
     thing which is better for you than a servant? When you (both) go to 
     your beds, say 'Allahu Akbar' thirty-four times, and 'Subhan Allah'

     that Allah's Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he used to 
     think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he 
     invoked his Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, "O 'Aisha!) 
     Do you know that Allah has advised me as to the problem I consulted 
     Him about?" 'Aisha said, "O Allah's Apostle! What's that?" He said, 
     "Two men came to me and one of them sat at my head and the other at my
     feet, and one of them asked his companion, 'What is wrong with this 
     man?' The latter replied, 'He is under the effect of magic.' The 
     former asked, 'Who has worked magic on him?' The latter replied, 
     'Labid bin Al-A'sam.' The former asked, 'With what did he work the 
     magic?' The latter replied, 'With a comb and the hair, which are stuck
     to the comb, and the skin of pollen of a date-palm tree.' The former 
     asked, 'Where is that?' The latter replied, 'It is in Dharwan.' 
     Dharwan was a well in the dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani 
     Zuraiq. Allah's Apostle went to that well and returned to 'Aisha, 
     saying, 'By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion 
     of Hinna, (1) and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.' 
     'Aisha added, Allah's Apostle came to me and informed me about the 
     well. I asked the Prophet, 'O Allah's Apostle, why didn't you take out
     the skin of pollen?' He said, 'As for me, Allah has cured me and I 
     hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they 
     might learn and harm others with).' "

     'If they saw You, they would worship You more devoutly and celebrate 
     Your Glory more deeply, and declare Your freedom from any resemblance 
     to anything more often.' Allah says (to the angels), 'What do they ask
     Me for?' The angels reply, 'They ask You for Paradise.' Allah says (to
     the angels), 'Did they see it?' The angels say, 'No! By Allah, O Lord!
     They did not see it.' Allah says, How it would have been if they saw 
     it?' The angels say, 'If they saw it, they would have greater 
     covetousness for it and would seek It with greater zeal and would have
     greater desire for it.' Allah says, 'From what do they seek refuge?' 
     The angels reply, 'They seek refuge from the (Hell) Fire.' Allah says,
     'Did they see it?' The angels say, 'No By Allah, O Lord! They did not 
     see it.' Allah says, How it would have been if they saw it?' The 
     angels say, 'If they saw it they would flee from it with the extreme 
     fleeing and would have extreme fear from it.' Then Allah says, 'I make
     you witnesses that I have forgiven them."' Allah's Apostle added, "One
     of the angels would say, 'There was so-and-so amongst them, and he was
     not one of them, but he had just come for some need.' Allah would say,
     'These are those people whose companions will not be reduced to 
     misery.' "

<p>

     The Prophet started ascending a high place or hill. A man (amongst his
     companions) ascended it and shouted in a loud voice, "La ilaha 
     illal-lahu wallahu Akbar." (At that time) Allah's Apostle was riding 
     his mule. Allah's Apostle said, "You are not calling upon a deaf or an
     absent one." and added, "O Abu Musa (or, O 'Abdullah)! Shall I tell 
     you a sentence from the treasure of Paradise?" I said, "Yes." He said,
     "La haul a wala quwwata illa billah,"

     Narrated Shaqiq:
<p>

     While we were waiting for 'Abdullah (bin Mas'ud). Yazid bin Muawiya 
     came. I said (to him), "Will you sit down?" He said, "No, but I will 
     go into the house (of Ibn Mas'ud) and let your companion (Ibn Mas'ud) 
     come out to you; and if he should not (come out), I will come out and 
     sit (with you)." Then 'Abdullah came out, holding the hand of Yazid, 
     addressed us, saying, "I know that you are assembled here, but the 
     reason that prevents me from coming out to you, is that Allah's 
     Apostle used to preach to us at intervals during the days, lest we 
     should become bored."
