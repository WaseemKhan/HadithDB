     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     Whenever the Prophet took a bath after Janaba he started by washing 
     his hands and then performed ablution like that for the prayer. After 
     that he would put his fingers in water and move the roots of his hair 
     with them, and then pour three handfuls of water over his head and 
     then pour water all over his body.

     withdrew his feet from that place (the place where he took the bath)

     Janaba.

     asked 'Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam, Talha bin 
     'Ubaidullah and Ubai bin Ka'b and a gave the same reply. (Abu Aiylub 
     said that he had heard that from Allah's Apostle ) (This order was 
     cancelled later on so one has to take a bath. See, Hadith No. 180).

     Narrated Ubai bin Ka'b:

     I asked Allah's Apostle about a man who engages in sexual intercourse 
     with his wife but does not discharge. He replied, "He should wash the 
     parts which comes in contact with the private parts of the woman, 
     perform ablution and then pray." (Abu 'Abdullah said, "Taking a bath 
     is safer and is the last order.")
