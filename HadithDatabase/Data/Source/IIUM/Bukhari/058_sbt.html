     Narrated Ghailan bin Jarir:
<p>

     I asked Anas, "Tell me about the name 'Al-Ansar.; Did you call 
     yourselves by it or did Allah call you by it?" He said, "Allah called 
     us by it." We used to visit Anas (at Basra) and he used to narrate to 
     us the virtues and deeds of the Ansar, and he used to address me or a 
     person from the tribe of Al-Azd and say, "Your tribe did so-and-so on 
     such-and-such a day."

     The day of Bu'ath (i.e. Day of fighting between the two tribes of the 
     Ansar, the Aus and Khazraj) was brought about by Allah for the good of
     His Apostle so that when Allah's Apostle reached (Medina), the tribes 
     of Medina had already divided and their chiefs had been killed and 
     wounded. So Allah had brought about the battle for the good of H is 
     Apostle in order that they (i.e. the Ansar) might embrace Islam.

     strange: While our swords are still dribbling with the blood of 
     Quraish, our war booty are distributed amongst them." When this news 
     reached the Prophet he called the Ansar and said, "What is this news 
     that has reached me from you?" They used not to tell lies, so they 
     replied, "What has reached you is true." He said, "Doesn't it please 
     you that the people take the booty to their homes and you take Allah's
     Apostle to your homes? If the Ansar took their way through a valley or
     a mountain pass, I would take the Ansar's valley or a mountain pass."

     the two you like and tell me, so that I may divorce her, and when she 
     finishes her prescribed period (i.e. 'Idda) of divorce, then marry 
     her." Abdur-Rahman said, "May Allah bless your family and property for
     you; where is your market?" So they showed him the Qainuqa' market. 
     (He went there and) returned with a profit in the form of dried yogurt
     and butter. He continued going (to the market) till one day he came, 
     bearing the traces of yellow scent. The Prophet asked, "What is this 
     (scent)?" He replied, "I got married." The Prophet asked, "How much 
     Mahr did you give her?" He replied, "I gave her a date-stone of gold 
     or a gold piece equal to the weight of a date-stone." (The narrator, 
     Ibrahim, is in doubt as to which is correct.)

     Narrated Anas:
<p>

     On the day of the battle of Uhud, the people ran away, leaving the 
     Prophet , but Abu- Talha was shielding the Prophet with his shield in 
     front of him. Abu Talha was a strong, experienced archer who used to 
     keep his arrow bow strong and well stretched. On that day he broke two
     or three arrow bows. If any man passed by carrying a quiver full of 
     arrows, the Prophet would say to him, "Empty it in front of Abu 
     Talha." When the Prophet stated looking at the enemy by raising his 
     head, Abu Talha said, "O Allah's Prophet! Let my parents be sacrificed
     for your sake! Please don't raise your head and make it visible, lest 
     an arrow of the enemy should hit you. Let my neck and chest be wounded
     instead of yours." (On that day) I saw 'Aisha, the daughter of Abu 
     Bakr and Um Sulaim both lifting their dresses up so that I was able to
     see the ornaments of their legs, and they were carrying the water 
     skins of their arms to pour the water into the mouths of the thirsty 
     people and then go back and fill them and come to pour the water into 
     the mouths of the people again. (On that day) Abu Talha's sword fell 
     from his hand twice or thrice.

     While I was sitting in the Mosque of Medina, there entered a man

     said, "He is one of the people of Paradise." He prayed two light Rakat

     lower end was fixed in the earth and the upper end was in the sky, and
     at its upper end there was a (ring-shaped) hand-hold. I was told to 
     climb it. I said, "I can't." "Then a servant came to me and lifted my 
     clothes from behind and I climbed till I reached the top (of the 
     pillar). Then I got hold of the hand-hold, and I was told to hold it

     hand. I narrated al I that to the Prophet who said, 'The garden is

     will remain as a Muslim till you die." The narrator added: "The man

<p>

     The Prophet met Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail in the bottom of (the valley

     was presented to the Prophet but he refused to eat from it. (Then it

     slaughter in the name of your stone idols. I eat none but those things
     on which Allah's Name has been mentioned at the time of slaughtering."
     Zaid bin 'Amr used to criticize the way Quraish used to slaughter 
     their animals, and used to say, "Allah has created the sheep and He 
     has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for
     it from the earth; yet you slaughter it in other than the Name of

     about a true religion to follow. He met a Jewish religious scholar and
     asked him about their religion. He said, "I intend to embrace your 
     religion, so tell me some thing about it." The Jew said, "You will not
     embrace our religion unless you receive your share of Allah's Anger." 
     Zaid said, "'I do not run except from Allah's Anger, and I will never 
     bear a bit of it if I have the power to avoid it. Can you tell me of 
     some other religion?" He said, "I do not know any other religion 
     except the Hanif." Zaid enquired, "What is Hanif?" He said, "Hanif is 
     the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a Jew nor a 
     Christian, and he used to worship None but Allah (Alone)" Then Zaid 
     went out and met a Christian religious scholar and told him the same 
     as before. The Christian said, "You will not embrace our religion 
     unless you get a share of Allah's Curse." Zaid replied, "I do not run 
     except from Allah's Curse, and I will never bear any of Allah's Curse 
     and His Anger if I have the power to avoid them. Will you tell me of 
     some other religion?" He replied, "I do not know any other religion

     the religion of (the prophet) Abraham  who was neither a Jew nor a 
     Christian and he used to worship None but Allah (Alone)" When Zaid 
     heard their Statement about (the religion of) Abraham, he left that 
     place, and when he came out, he raised both his hands and said, "O 
     Allah! I make You my Witness that I am on the religion of Abraham."

     used to preserve the lives of little girls: If somebody wanted to kill
     his daughter he would say to him, "Do not kill her for I will feed her
     on your behalf." So he would take her, and when she grew up nicely, he
     would say to her father, "Now if you want her, I will give her to you,

     had broken so he said to the laborer, "Will you help me by giving me a
     rope in order to tie the handle of my bag lest the camels should run 
     away from me?" The laborer gave him a rope and the latter tied his bag
     with it. When the caravan halted, all the camels' legs were tied with 
     their fetters except one camel. The employer asked the laborer, "Why, 
     from among all the camels has this camel not been fettered?" He 
     replied, "There is no fetter for it." The Quraishi asked, "Where is 
     its fetter?" and hit the laborer with a stick that caused his death 
     (later on Just before his death) a man from Yemen passed by him. The 
     laborer asked (him), "Will you go for the pilgrimage?" He replied, "I 
     do not think I will attend it, but perhaps I will attend it." The 
     (Hashimi) laborer said, "Will you please convey a message for me once 
     in your life?" The other man said, "yes." The laborer wrote: 'When you
     attend the pilgrimage, call the family of Quraish, and if they respond
     to you, call the family of Banu Hashim, and if they respond to you, 
     ask about Abu Talib and tell him that so-and-so has killed me for a 
     fetter." Then the laborer expired. When the employer reached (Mecca), 
     Abu Talib visited him and asked, "What has happened to our companion?"
     He said, "He became ill and I looked after him nicely (but he died) 
     and I buried him." Then Abu Talib said, "The deceased deserved this 
     from you." After some time, the messenger whom the laborer has asked 
     to convey the message, reached during the pilgrimage season. He 
     called, "O the family of Quraish!" The people replied, "This is 
     Quraish." Then he called, "O the family of Banu Hashim!" Again the 
     people replied, "This is Banu Hashim." He asked, "Who is Abu Talib?" 
     The people replied, "This is Abu Talib." He said, "'So-and-so has 
     asked me to convey a message to you that so-and-so has killed him for 
     a fetter (of a camel)." Then Abu Talib went to the (Quraishi) killer 
     and said to him, "Choose one of three alternatives: (i) If you wish, 
     give us one-hundred camels because you have murdered our companion, 
     (ii) or if you wish, fifty of your men should take an oath that you 
     have not murdered our companion, and if you do not accept this, (iii) 
     we will kill you in Qisas." The killer went to his people and they 
     said, "We will take an oath." Then a woman from Banu Hashim who was 
     married to one of them (i.e.the Quraishis) and had given birth to a 
     child from him, came to Abu Talib and said, "O Abu Talib! I wish that 
     my son from among the fifty men, should be excused from this oath, and
     that he should not take the oath where the oath-taking is carried on."
     Abu Talib excused him. Then another man from them came (to Abu Talib) 
     and said, "O Abu Talib! You want fifty persons to take an oath instead
     of giving a hundred camels, and that means each man has to give two 
     camels (in case he does not take an oath). So there are two camels I 
     would like you to accept from me and excuse me from taking an oath 
     where the oaths are taken. Abu Talib accepted them from him. Then 48 
     men came and took the oath. Ibn 'Abbas further said:) By Him in Whose 
     Hand my life is, before the end of that year, none of those 48 persons
     remained alive.

     the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of 
     the news of Heaven. Listen to what he says and come back to me." So 
     his brother set out and came to the Prophet and listened to some of 
     his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him. "I have seen him 
     enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not poetry." 
     Abu Dhar said, "You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted." He 
     then took his journey-food and carried a water-skin of his, containing
     some water till be reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched 
     for the Prophet and though he did not know him, he hated to ask

     the Mosque and stayed there all the day long without being perceived

     place. 'Ali passed by him and said, "Has the man not known his 
     dwelling place yet?" So 'Ali awakened him and took him with him and 
     none of them spoke to the other about anything. When it was the third 
     day. 'Ali did the same and Abu Dhar stayed with him. Then 'Ali said 
     "Will you tell me what has brought you here?" Abu Dhar said, "If you 
     give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell you." 
     'Ali promised him, and he informed 'Ali about the matter. 'Ali said,

     up, accompany me, and if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if 
     to pass water, but if I go on, follow me and enter the place which I 
     will enter." Abu Dhar did so, and followed 'Ali till he entered the 
     place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened
     to some of the Prophet's talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The 
     Prophet said to him, "Go back to your people and inform them (about 
     it) till you receive my order." Abu Dhar said, "By Him in Whose Hand 
     my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst them (i.e. 
     the pagans)." So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said 
     as loudly as possible, "I bear witness that None has the right to be 
     worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah." The 
     People got up and beat him painfully. Then Al-Abbas came and knelt

     Don't you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and your 
     trade to Sha'm is through their way?" So he rescued him from them. Abu

     That Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin 'Abu 
     Yaghuth had said to him, "What prevents you from speaking to your 
     uncle 'Uthman regarding his brother Al-Walid bin 'Uqba?" The people 
     were speaking against the latter for what he had done. 'Ubaidullah 
     said, "So I kept waiting for 'Uthman, and when he went out for the 
     prayer, I said to him, 'I have got something to say to you as a piece 
     of advice.' 'Uthman said, 'O man! I seek Refuge with Allah from you. 
     So I went away. When I finished my prayer, I sat with Al-Miswar and 
     Ibn 'Abu Yaghuth and talked to both of them of what I had said to 
     'Uthman and what he had said to me. They said, 'You have done your 
     duty.' So while I was sitting with them. 'Uthman's Messenger came to 
     me. They said, 'Allah has put you to trial." I set out and when I 
     reached 'Uthman, he said, 'What is your advice which you mentioned a 
     while ago?' I recited Tashahhud and added, 'Allah has sent Muhammad 
     and has revealed the Holy Book (i.e. Quran) to him. You (O Uthman!) 
     were amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle 
     and had faith in him. And you took part in the first two migrations 
     (to Ethiopia and to Medina), and you enjoyed the company of Allah's 
     Apostle and learned his traditions and advice. Now the people are 
     talking much about Al-Walid bin 'Uqba and so it is your duty to impose
     on him the legal punishment.' 'Uthman then said to me, 'O my nephew! 
     Did you ever meet Allah's Apostle ?' I said, 'No, but his knowledge 
     has reached me as it has reached the virgin in her seclusion.' 'Uthman
     then recited Tashahhud and said, 'No doubt, Allah has sent Muhammad 
     with the Truth and has revealed to him His Holy Book (i.e. Quran) and 
     I was amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle
     and I had faith in Muhammad's Mission, and I had performed the first 
     two migrations as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Allah's 
     Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance to him. By Allah, I never 
     disobeyed him and never cheated him till Allah caused him to die. Then
     Allah made Abu Bakr Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to 
     him, nor did I cheat him. Then 'Umar became Caliph, and by Allah, I 
     was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then I became 
     Caliph. Have I not then the same rights over you as they had over me?'
     I replied in the affirmative. 'Uthman further said, 'The what are 
     these talks which are reaching me from you? As for what you ha 
     mentioned about Al-Walid bin 'Uqb; Allah willing, I shall give him the
     leg; punishment justly. Then Uthman ordered that Al-Walid be flogged 
     fort lashes. He ordered 'Ali to flog him an he himself flogged him as 
     well."

     Narrated Abbas bin Malik:
<p>

     Malik bin Sasaa said that Allah's Apostle described to them his Night 
     Journey saying, "While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly 
     someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here." I asked 
     Al-Jarud who was by my side, "What does he mean?" He said, "It means 
     from his throat to his pubic area," or said, "From the top of the 
     chest." The Prophet further said, "He then took out my heart. Then a 
     gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was 
     filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a 
     white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey 
     was brought to me." (On this Al-Jarud asked, "Was it the Buraq, O Abu 
     Hamza?" I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, 
     "The animal's step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point 
     within the reach of the animal's sight. I was carried on it, and 
     Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.
<p>

     When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, 'Who is it?' 
     Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' 
     Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has Muhammad been called?'
     Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed.
     What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went 
     over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). 'This 
     is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.' So I greeted him and he
     returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious son 
     and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the 
     second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, 
     'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is 
     accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he 
     been called?' Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, 
     'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened.
<p>

     When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and 
     'Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to 
     me), 'These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.' So I greeted
     them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, 'You are 
     welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended 
     with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It 
     was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who
     is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has 
     he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said,
     'He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened,
     and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said
     (to me), 'This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.' So I greeted him 
     and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O 
     pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the
     fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who 
     is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying 
     you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?'
     Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed,
     what an excel lent visit his is!' 
<p>

     The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I 
     saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Idris; pay him your 
     greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and 
     said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then 
     Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to
     be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It 
     was asked. 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It 
     was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. 
     Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So 
     when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), 
     Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.' I 
     greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are 
     welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended 
     with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It 
     was asked. 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who
     is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has 
     he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, 'He 
     is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' 
<p>

     When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said 
     (to me),' This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and 
     he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious 
     brother and pious Prophet.' When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. 
     Someone asked him, 'What makes you weep?' Moses said, 'I weep because 
     after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers 
     will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.' Then 
     Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate 
     to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' 
     It was asked,' Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' 
     It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the 
     affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent 
     visit his is!'
<p>

     So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel
     said (to me), 'This is your father; pay your greetings to him.' So I 
     greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are 
     welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.' Then I was made to ascend to
     Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! 
     Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and 
     its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, 'This 
     is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four 
     rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, 'What are these
     two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?' He replied,' As for the hidden 
     rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the
     Nile and the Euphrates.' 
<p>

     Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma'mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a 
     container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of 
     honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, 'This is 
     the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.' Then
     the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I
     returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), 'What have you been 
     ordered to do?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers
     a day.' Moses said, 'Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, 
     and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my 
     level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask 
     for reduction to lessen your followers' burden.' So I went back, and 
     Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he 
     repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to 
     Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he 
     said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten 
     prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice,
     so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.
<p>

     When I came back to Moses, he said, 'What have you been ordered?' I 
     replied, 'I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.' He said,
     'Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have 
     got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level 
     best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction 
     to lessen your follower's burden.' I said, 'I have requested so much 
     of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender 
     to Allah's Order.' When I left, I heard a voice saying, 'I have passed
     My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshipers."

     the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing 
     became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with 
     it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some 
     Ansari women who said, "Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good 
     luck." Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the 
     marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and
     my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine
     years of age.

     be sacrificed for you." We became astonished at this. The people said,
     "Look at this old man! Allah's Apostle talks about a Slave of Allah to
     whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this 
     worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says. 'our

     Apostle   who had been given option, and Abu Bakr knew it better than 
     we. Allah's Apostle added, "No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more 
     than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. 
     And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers, I would certainly 
     have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is. sufficient. Let

<blockquote>
<p>

     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     (the wife of the Prophet) I never remembered my parents believing in 
     any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam), and (I don't 
     remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Allah's 
     Apostle in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were put 
     to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to 
     the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn 
     Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, "O Abu 
     Bakr! Where are you going?" Abu Bakr replied, "My people have turned 
     me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship 
     my Lord." Ibn Ad-Daghina said, "O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not 
     leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the
     destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your 
     Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and
     help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go 
     back and worship your Lord in your town." 
<p>

     So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the 
     evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them.
     "A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be 
     driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the 
     destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and 
     kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps 
     the calamity-stricken persons?" So the people of Quraish could not 
     refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, 
     "Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite 
     there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should
     not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women
     and children." Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr 
     stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not 
     pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house. 
<p>

     Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his 
     house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and 
     children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. 
     They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who 
     used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the 
     Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so 
     they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, "We 
     accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should 
     worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and 
     he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites
     the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and
     children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to 
     confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he 
     insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your 
     obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, 
     but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly." Ibn 
     Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, ("O Abu Bakr!) You know well 
     what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide
     by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, 
     because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a
     contract I have made on behalf of another man." Abu Bakr replied, "I 
     release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the 
     protection from Allah." 
<p>

     At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, "In
     a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm 
     trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts." So, some people 
     migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously 
     migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also 
     prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Apostle said to him, "Wait 
     for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also." 
     Abu Bakr said, "Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed
     for you!" The Prophet said, "Yes." So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the
     sake of Allah's Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two 
     she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on 
     being struck by a stick for four months. 
<p>

     One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone 
     said to Abu Bakr, "This is Allah's Apostle with his head covered 
     coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before." Abu Bakr 
     said, "May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come
     at this hour except for a great necessity." So Allah's Apostle came 
     and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he 
     entered, he said to Abu Bakr. "Tell everyone who is present with you 
     to go away." Abu Bakr replied, "There are none but your family. May my
     father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "i
     have been given permission to migrate." Abu Bakr said, "Shall I 
     accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's 
     Apostle!" Allah's Apostle said, "Yes." Abu Bakr said, "O Allah's 
     Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two 
     she-camels of mine." Allah's Apostle replied, "(I will accept it) with
     payment." So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food
     in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from
     her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for 
     that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two 
     belts). 
<p>

     Then Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of 
     Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who 
     was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver 
     night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning 
     he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He 
     would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark
     he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed 
     slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu 
     Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the 
     sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their
     sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it.
     'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark
     (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. 
     Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani 
     Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he
     was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was
     on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr 
     trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to 
     bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the
     morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin 
     Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them 
     along the sea-shore.
<p>

     The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju'sham said that his father informed him 
     that he heard Suraqa bin Ju'sham saying, "The messengers of the 
     heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for 
     the persons why would kill or arrest Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr, a 
     reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was sitting in one of the 
     gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and 
     stood up while we were sitting, and said, "O Suraqa! No doubt, I have 
     just seen some people far away on the seashore, and I think they are 
     Muhammad and his companions." Suraqa added, "I too realized that it 
     must have been they. But I said 'No, it is not they, but you have seen
     so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.' I stayed in the 
     gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and 
     ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and 
     keep it ready for me. 
<p>

     Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging 
     the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I 
     reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached 
     them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down 
     from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the 
     divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. 
     the Prophet and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came 
     out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance 
     to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Quran by 
     Allah's Apostle who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was
     doing it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground
     up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got
     up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when it
     stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up in the 
     sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and 
     the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel 
     secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When 
     I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind 
     that the cause of Allah's Apostle (i.e. Islam) will become victorious.
     So I said to him, "Your people have assigned a reward equal to the 
     bloodmoney for your head." Then I told them all the plans the people 
     of Mecca had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey 
     food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for 
     anything, but the Prophet said, "Do not tell others about us." Then I 
     requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He 
     ordered 'Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then 
     Allah's Apostle proceeded on his way.
<p>

     Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah's Apostle met Az-Zubair in a 
     caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair 
     provided Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When
     the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah's 
     Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra 
     every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon 
     forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they 
     returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up 
     the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and
     he saw Allah's Apostle and his companions dressed in white clothes, 
     emerging out of the desert mirage. 
<p>

     The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, "O you 
     'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!" So all
     the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's Apostle on the 
     summit of Harra. The Prophet turned with them to the right and 
     alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday
     in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people 
     while Allah's Apostle sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who 
     came and had not seen Allah's Apostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr,
     but when the sunshine fell on Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr came 
     forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to 
     know Allah's Apostle. Allah's Apostle stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf 
     for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was 
     founded on piety. Allah's Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his 
     she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his 
     she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Apostle 
     at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that 
     place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the 
     orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When 
     his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Apostle said, "This place, Allah 
     willing, will be our abiding place." Allah's Apostle then called the 
     two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he 
     might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, "No, but we will give it
     as a gift, O Allah's Apostle!" Allah's Apostle then built a mosque 
     there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its 
     building and while doing so, he was saying "This load is better than 
     the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and 
     purer and better rewardable." He was also saying, "O Allah! The actual
     reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the 
     Ansar and the Emigrants." Thus the Prophet recited (by way of proverb)
     the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me.
<p>

     (Ibn Shibab said, "In the Hadiths it does not occur that Allah's 
     Apostle
<p>

     recited a complete poetic verse other than this one.")

<p>

     Allah's Apostle arrived at Medina with Abu Bakr, riding behind him on 
     the same camel. Abu Bakr was an elderly man known to the people, while
     Allah's Apostle was a youth that was unknown. Thus, if a man met Abu 
     Bakr, he would day, "O Abu Bakr! Who is this man in front of you?" Abu
     Bakr would say, "This man shows me the Way," One would think that Abu 
     Bakr meant the road, while in fact, Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue 
     and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a horse-rider persuing 
     them. He said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is a horse-rider persuing us."
     The Prophet looked behind and said, "O Allah! Cause him to fall down."
     So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider,
     Suraqa said, "O Allah's Prophet! Order me whatever you want." The 
     Prophet said, "Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach 
     us." So, in the first part of the day Suraqa was an enemy of Allah's 
     Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a protector. Then Allah's 
     Apostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to the
     Ansar, and they came to Allah's Prophet and Abu Bakr, and having 
     greeted them, they said, "Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed." 
     Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, 
     surrounded them. The news that Allah's Prophet had come circulated in 
     Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking and saying 
     "Allah's Prophet has come! Allah's Prophet has come! So the Prophet 
     went on till he alighted near the house of Abu Aiyub. While the 
     Prophet was speaking with the family members of Abu Aiyub, 'Abdullah 
     bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he himself was picking 
     the dates for his family from his family garden. He hurried to the 
     Prophet carrying the dates which he had collected for his family from 
     the garden. He listened to Allah's Prophet and then went home. 
<p>

     Then Allah's Prophet said, "Which is the nearest of the houses of our 
     Kith and kin?" Abu Aiyub replied, "Mine, O Allah's Prophet! This is my
     house and this is my gate." The Prophet said, "Go and prepare a place 
     for our midday rest." Abu Aiyub said, "Get up (both of you) with 
     Allah's Blessings." So when Allah's Prophet went into the house, 
     'Abdullah bin Salaim came and said "I testify that you (i.e. Muhammad)
     are Apostle of Allah and that you have come with the Truth. The Jews 
     know well that I am their chief and the son of their chief and the 
     most learned amongst them and the son of the most learned amongst 
     them. So send for them (i.e. Jews) and ask them about me before they 
     know that I have embraced Islam, for if they know that they will say 
     about me things which are not correct." So Allah's Apostle sent for 
     them, and they came and entered. Allah's Apostle said to them, "O (the
     group of) Jews! Woe to you: be afraid of Allah. By Allah except Whom 
     none has the right to be worshipped, you people know for certain, that
     I am Apostle of Allah and that I have come to you with the Truth, so 
     embrace Islam." The Jews replied, "We do not know this." So they said 
     this to the Prophet and he repeated it thrice. Then he said, "What 
     sort of a man is 'Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?" They said, "He is 
     our chief and the son of our chief and the most learned man, and the 
     son of the most learned amongst us." He said, "What would you think if
     he should embrace Islam?" They said, "Allah forbid! He can not embrace
     Islam." He said, " What would you think if he should embrace Islam?" 
     They said, "Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam." He said, "What 
     would you think if he should embrace Islam?" They said, "Allah forbid!
     He can not embrace Islam." He said, "O Ibn Salaim! Come out to them." 
     He came out and said, "O (the group of) Jews! 8e afraid of Allah 
     except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. You know for certain 
     that he is Apostle of Allah and that he has brought a True Religion!' 
     They said, "You tell a lie." On that Allah's Apostle turned them out.

<p>

     When 'Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina and the Prophet established 
     the bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi-al-Ansari, 
     Saud suggested that 'Abdur-Rahman should accept half of his property 
     and family. 'Abdur Rahman said, "May Allah bless you in your family 
     and property; guide me to the market." So 'Abdur-Rahman (while doing 
     business in the market) made some profit of some condensed dry yoghurt
     and butter. After a few days the Prophet saw him wearing clothes 
     stained with yellow perfume. The Prophet asked, "What is this, O 
     'Abdur-Rahman?" He said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have married an Ansar' 
     woman." The Prophet asked, "What have you given her as Mahr?" He (i.e.
     'Abdur-Rahman) said, "A piece of gold, about the weight of a date 
     stone." Then the Prophet said, Give a banquet, even though of a 
     sheep."

     Narrated Anas:
<p>

     When the news of the arrival of the Prophet at Medina reached 
     'Abdullah bin Salam, he went to him to ask him about certain things, 
     He said, "I am going to ask you about three things which only a 
     Prophet can answer: What is the first sign of The Hour? What is the 
     first food which the people of Paradise will eat? Why does a child 
     attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?" The Prophet 
     replied, "Gabriel has just now informed me of that." Ibn Salam said, 
     "He (i.e. Gabriel) is the enemy of the Jews amongst the angels. The 
     Prophet said, "As for the first sign of The Hour, it will be a fire 
     that will collect the people from the East to the West. As for the 
     first meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the 
     caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. As for the child, if the man's
     discharge proceeds the woman's discharge, the child attracts the 
     similarity to the man, and if the woman's discharge proceeds the 
     man's, then the child attracts the similarity to the woman." 
<p>

     On this, 'Abdullah bin Salam said, "I testify that None has the right 
     to be worshipped except Allah, and that you are the Apostle of Allah."
     and added, "O Allah's Apostle! Jews invent such lies as make one 
     astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my 
     conversion to I slam . " The Jews came, and the Prophet said, "What 
     kind of man is 'Abdullah bin Salam among you?" They replied, "The best
     of us and the son of the best of us and the most superior among us, 
     and the son of the most superior among us. "The Prophet said, "What 
     would you think if 'Abdullah bin Salam should embrace Islam?" They 
     said, "May Allah protect him from that." The Prophet repeated his 
     question and they gave the same answer. Then 'Abdullah came out to 
     them and said, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped 
     except Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah!" On this, the 
     Jews said, "He is the most wicked among us and the son of the most 
     wicked among us." So they degraded him. On this, he (i.e. 'Abdullah 
     bin Salam) said, "It is this that I was afraid of, O Allah's Apostle.

     Narrated Abu Al-Minhal 'AbdurRahman bin Mut'im:
<p>

     A partner of mine sold some Dirhams on credit in the market. I said, 
     "Glorified be Allah! Is this legal?" He replied, "Glorified be Allah! 
     By Allah, when I sold them in the market, nobody objected to it." Then
     I asked Al-Bara' bin 'Azib (about it) he said, "We used to make such a
     transaction when the Prophet came to Medina. So he said, 'There is no 
     harm in it if it is done from hand to hand, but it is not allowed on 
     credit.' Go to Zaid bin Al- Arqam and ask him about it for he was the 
     greatest trader of all of us." So I asked Zaid bin Al-Arqam., and he 
     said the same (as Al-Bara) did."
