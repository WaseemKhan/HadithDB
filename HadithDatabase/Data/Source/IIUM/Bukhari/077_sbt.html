     Narrated 'Abdullah:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle, the truthful and truly-inspired, said, "Each one of 
     you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns
     into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece
     of flesh for a similar period (of forty days) and then Allah sends an 
     angel and orders him to write four things, i.e., his provision, his 
     age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the blessed (in the 
     Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Allah, a person
     among you (or a man) may do deeds of the people of the Fire till there
     is only a cubit or an arm-breadth distance between him and the Fire, 
     but then that writing (which Allah has ordered the angel to write) 
     precedes, and he does the deeds of the people of Paradise and enters 
     it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise till there is
     only a cubit or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing 
     precedes and he does the deeds of the people of the Fire and enters 
     it."

     The Prophet said, "Allah puts an angel in charge of the uterus and the
     angel says, 'O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O 
     Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes to 
     complete its creation, the angel asks, 'O Lord, (will it be) a male or
     a female? A wretched (an evil doer) or a blessed (doer of good)? How 
     much will his provisions be? What will his age be?' So all that is 
     written while the creature is still in the mother's womb."

     A man said, "O Allah's Apostle! Can the people of Paradise be known 
     (differentiated) from the people of the Fire; The Prophet replied, 
     "Yes." The man said, "Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?" The 
     Prophet said, "Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been 
     created to do or he will do those deeds which will be made easy for 
     him to do." (i.e. everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will 
     lead him to his destined place for which he has been created).

<p>

     We witnessed along with Allah's Apostle the Khaibar (campaign). 
     Allah's Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a 
     Muslim, "This man is from the people of the Fire." When the battle 
     started, the man fought very bravely and received a great number of 
     wounds and got crippled. On that, a man from among the companions of 
     the Prophet came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Do you know what the 
     man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought
     very bravely for Allah's Cause and he has received many wounds." The 
     Prophet said, "But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire." Some 
     of the Muslims were about to have some doubt about that statement. So 
     while the man was in that state, the pain caused by the wounds 
     troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took out
     an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among 
     the Muslims to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Allah has
     made your statement true. So-and-so has committed suicide." Allah's 
     Apostle said, "O Bilal! Get up and announce in public: None will enter
     Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this religion (Islam) 
     with a wicked man."

     Narrated Sahl bin Sa'd:
<p>

     There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims on behalf 
     of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The
     Prophet looked at him and said. "If anyone would like to see a man 
     from the people of the Fire, let him look at this (brave man)." On 
     that, a man from the People (Muslims) followed him, and he was in that
     state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he was wounded, 
     and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his 
     breasts (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his
     shoulders. Then the man (who was watching that person) went quickly to
     the Prophet and said, "I testify that you are Allah's Apostle!" The 
     Prophet asked him, "Why do you say that?" He said, "You said about 
     so-and-so, 'If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the 
     Fire, he should look at him.' He fought most bravely of all of us on 
     behalf of the Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim 
     (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he hastened to die and committed 
     suicide." There-upon the Prophet said, "A man may do the deeds of the 
     people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise, 
     and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he 
     belongs to the people of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds 
     are decided by the last actions (deeds)".
