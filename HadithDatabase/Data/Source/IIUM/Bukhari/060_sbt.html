     Narrated Abu Said bin Al-Mu'alla: 
<p>

     While I was praying in the Mosque, Allah's Apostle called me but I did
     not respond to him. Later I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I was praying." 
     He said, "Didn't Allah say'--"Give your response to Allah (by obeying 
     Him) and to His Apostle when he calls you." (8.24)
<p>

     He then said to me, "I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest 
     Sura in the Qur'an, before you leave the Mosque." Then he got hold of 
     my hand, and when he intended to leave (the Mosque), I said to him, 
     "Didn't you say to me, 'I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest 
     Sura in the Quran?' He said, "Al-Hamdu-Lillah Rabbi-l-Alamin (i.e. 
     Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds) which is Al-Sab'a 
     Al-Mathani (i.e. seven repeatedly recited Verses) and the Grand Qur'an
     which has been given to me."

<p>

     The Prophet said, "On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will 
     assemble and say, 'Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our 
     Lord.' So they will go to Adam and say, 'You are the father of all the
     people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the 
     angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so
     please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from
     this place of ours.' Adam will say, 'I am not fit for this (i.e. 
     intercession for you).' Then Adam will remember his sin and feel 
     ashamed thereof. He will say, 'Go to Noah, for he was the first 
     Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.' They will go to 
     him and Noah will say,
<p>

     'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He will remember his appeal to 
     his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed 
     thereof and will say, 'Go to the Khalil--r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).' 
     They will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this 
     undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and
     gave him the Torah .' So they will go to him and he will say, 'I am 
     not fit for this undertaking.' and he will mention (his) killing a 
     person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof 
     before his Lord, and he will say, 'Go to Jesus, Allah's Slave, His 
     Apostle and Allah's Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say,
     'I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah 
     whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.' So they will come 
     to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord's Permission and I 
     will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in 
     Prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He 
     wishes and then I will be addressed.' (Muhammad!) Raise your head. 
     Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will be 
     listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.' I 
     will raise my head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He
     will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me 
     (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come 
     back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will 
     happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for
     me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I will come back 
     for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and
     will say, 'None remains in Hell but those whom the Quran has 
     imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in 
     Hell.' " (The compiler) Abu 'Abdullah said: 'But those whom the Qur'an
     has imprisoned in Hell,' refers to the Statement of Allah:
<p>

     "They will dwell therein forever." (16.29)

     Narrated Anas:
<p>

     'Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of the arrival of Allah's Apostle 
     (at Medina) while he was on a farm collecting its fruits. So he came 
     to the Prophet and said, "I will ask you about three things which 
     nobody knows unless he be a prophet. Firstly, what is the first 
     portent of the Hour? What is the first meal of the people of Paradise?
     And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?'. The Prophet 
     said, "Just now Gabriel has informed me about that." 'Abdullah said, 
     "Gabriel?" The Prophet said, "Yes." 'Abdullah said, "He, among the 
     angels is the enemy of the Jews." On that the Prophet recited this 
     Holy Verse:--
<p>

     "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has 
     brought it (i.e. Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission." 
     (2.97) Then he added, "As for the first portent of the Hour, it will 
     be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as 
     for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite 
     (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man's discharge 
     proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and 
     if the woman's discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child 
     resembles the mother." On hearing that, 'Abdullah said, "I testify 
     that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are 
     the Apostle of Allah, O, Allah's Apostle; the Jews are liars, and if 
     they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse
     me of being a liar." In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) 
     and he asked them, "What is 'Abdullah's status amongst you?" They 
     replied, "He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son 
     of our chief." The Prophet said, "What would you think if 'Abdullah 
     bin Salam embraced Islam?" They replied, "May Allah protect him from 
     this!" Then 'Abdullah came out and said, "I testify that None has the 
     right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of 
     Allah." The Jews then said, "Abdullah is the worst of us and the son 
     of the worst of us," and disparaged him. On that 'Abdullah said, "O 
     Allah's Apostle! This is what I was afraid of!"

     So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were 
     revealed. I came to know that the Prophet had blamed some of his wives
     so I entered upon them and said, 'You should either stop (troubling

     you.' When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, 'O 'Umar! Does 
     Allah's Apostle haven't what he could advise his wives with, that you 
     try to advise them?' " Thereupon Allah revealed:--

     you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah).." (66.5)

     four months and ten days)." (2.234) 
<p>

     The widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of 
     waiting with her husband's family, so Allah revealed: "Those of you 
     who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives,
     a year's maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if 
     they leave (their residence), there is no blame on you for what they 
     do with themselves provided it is honorable.' (i.e. lawful marriage) 
     (2.240).
<p>

     So Allah entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for 
     seven months and twenty nights, and that is the completion of one 
     year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband's home) according 
     to the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Allah says:

     this period wherever she likes." 'Ata's aid: If she wished, she could 
     complete her 'Idda by staying in her dead husband's residence 
     according to the will or leave it according to Allah's Statement:--
<p>

     "There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves." 'Ata'

     Ibn Mas'ud about the pregnant widow whose husband had died?" He 
     replied, "Ibn Mas'ud said, 'Why do you impose on her the hard order 
     and don't let her make use of the leave? The shorter Sura of women 
     (i.e. Surat-at-Talaq) was revealed after the longer Sura (i.e. 
     Surat-al-Baqara)." (i.e. Her 'Idda is up till she delivers.)

<p>

     Whenever 'Abdullah bin 'Umar was asked about Salat-al-Khauf (i.e. 
     prayer of fear) he said, "The Imam comes forward with a group of 
     people and leads them in a one Rak'a prayer while another group from 
     them who has not prayed yet, stay between the praying group and the 
     enemy. When those who are with the Imam have finished their one Rak'a,
     they retreat and take the positions of those who have not prayed but 
     they will not finish their prayers with Taslim. Those who have not 
     prayed, come forward to offer a Rak'a with the Imam (while the first 
     group covers them from the enemy). Then the Imam, having offered two 
     Rakat, finishes his prayer. Then each member of the two groups offer 
     the second Rak'a alone after the Imam has finished his prayer. Thus 
     each one of the two groups will have offered two Rakat. But if the 
     fear is too great, they can pray standing on their feet or riding on 
     their mounts, facing the Qibla or not." Nafi added: I do not think 
     that 'Abdullah bin 'Umar narrated this except from Allah's Apostle

     Narrated Ibn Abbas:
<p>

     Abu Sufyan narrated to me personally, saying, "I set out during the 
     Truce that had been concluded between me and Allah's Apostle. While I 
     was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet was brought to Heraclius. 
     Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and 
     the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone
     from the people of this man who claims to be a prophet?' The people 
     replied, 'Yes.' So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and 
     we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he
     said, 'Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims 
     to be a prophet?' So they made me sit in front of him and made my 
     companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said 
     (to him). 'Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I am going 
     to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a 
     prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should contradict him 
     (instantly).' By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions would
     consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his
     translator, 'Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet's) family status 
     amongst you? I said, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us." 
     Heraclius said, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' He 
     said, 'Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what 
     he has said?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the 
     poor people?' I said, 'It is the poor who followed him.' He said, 'Is 
     the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?' I said, 'The are
     increasing.' He said, 'Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) 
     after embracing it, being displeased with it?' I said, 'No.' He said, 
     'Did you fight with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'How was your 
     fighting with him?' I said, 'The fighting between us was undecided and
     victory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon
     us and we inflict casualties upon him.' He said, 'Did he ever betray?'
     I said, 'No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not 
     know what he will do in it" Abu Sufyan added, "By Allah, I was not 
     able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. 
     Heraclius said, 'Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same 
     (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, 'No.' Then Heraclius told his 
     translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), 'I asked you about his family
     status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family 
     amongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among 
     their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a 
     king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his 
     fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) 
     was seeking to rule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. Then I asked you 
     regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among
     the people, and you said that they were only the poor (who follow 
     him). In fact, such are the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked 
     you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying 
     what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took 
     for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever
     tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his 
     followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, 
     being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when 
     it mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you whether
     his followers were increasing or decreasing You claimed that they were
     increasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I 
     asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that 
     you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was 
     undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he 
     inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them.
     Such is the case with the Apostles; they are out to test and the final
     victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; 
     you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, Apostles never betray.
     Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; 
     and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that 
     statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man 
     copying some sayings said before him." Abu Safyan said, "Heraclius 
     then asked me, 'What does he order you to do?' I said, 'He orders us 
     (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship 
     with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.' Then Heraclius said, 'If 
     whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew 
     that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to appear, but I never thought 
     that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach 
     him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his
     feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.' 
     Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allah's Apostle and read it 
     wherein was written:
<p>

     "In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This 
     letter is) from Muhammad, Apostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the 
     sovereign of Byzantine........ Peace be upon him who follows the Right
     Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you 
     will be saved (from Allah's Punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah will
     give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be 
     responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom (Allah's 
     Statement):--"O the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! 
     Come to a word common to you and us that we worship None but 
     Allah....bear witness that we are Muslims.' (3.64) 
<p>

     When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and 
     there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out." Abu 
     Sufyan added, "While coming out, I said to my companions, 'The 
     situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even 
     the king of Banu Al-Asfar is afraid of him.' So I continued to believe
     that Allah's Apostle would be victorious, till Allah made me embrace 
     Islam." Az-Zuhri said, "Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the 
     Byzantines and had them assembled in his house and said, 'O group of 
     Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and 
     that your kingdom should remain with you?' (Immediately after hearing 
     that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them 
     closed. Heraclius then said, 'Bring them back to me.' So he called 
     them and said, 'I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence 
     to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.' Then 
     the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with 
     him." (See Hadith No. 6,Vol 1)

     Narrated Usama bin Zaid:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle rode a donkey, equipped with a thick cloth-covering 
     made in Fadak and was riding behind him. He was going to pay visit to 
     Sad bin Ubada in Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj; and this incident 
     happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering 
     in which 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that was before
     'Abdullah bin Ubai embraced Islam. Behold in that gathering there were
     people of different religions: there were Muslims, pagans, 
     idol-worshippers and Jews, and in that gathering 'Abdullah bin Rawaha 
     was also present. When a cloud of dust raised by the donkey reached 
     that gathering, 'Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment 
     and then said, "Do not cover us with dust." Then Allah's Apostle 
     greeted them and stopped and dismounted and invited them to Allah 
     (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur'an. On that, 
     'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Saluil said, "O man ! There is nothing better 
     than that what you say. If it is the truth, then do not trouble us 
     with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount (or residence) and if 
     somebody comes to you, relate (your tales) to him." On that 'Abdullah 
     bin Rawaha said, "Yes, O Allah's Apostle! Bring it (i.e. what you want
     to say) to us in our gathering, for we love that." 
<p>

     So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another 
     till they were on the point of fighting with one another. The Prophet 
     kept on quietening them till they became quiet, whereupon the Prophet 
     rode his animal (mount) and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin 
     Ubada. The Prophet said to Sad, "Did you not hear what 'Abu Hub-b 
     said?" He meant 'Abdullah bin Ubai. "He said so-and-so." On that Sad 
     bin Ubada said, "O Allah's Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for by Him
     Who revealed the Book to you, Allah brought the Truth which was sent 
     to you at the time when the people of this town (i.e. Medina) had 
     decided unanimously to crown him and tie a turban on his head 
     (electing him as chief). But when Allah opposed that (decision) 
     through the Truth which Allah gave to you, he (i.e. 'Abdullah bin 
     Ubai) was grieved with jealously. and that caused him to do what you 
     have seen." So Allah's Apostle excused him, for the Prophet and his 
     companions used to forgive the pagans and the people of Scripture as 
     Allah had ordered them, and they used to put up with their mischief 
     with patience. Allah said: "And you shall certainly hear much that 
     will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you and 
     from the pagans........'(3.186) And Allah also said:--"Many of the 
     people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away as 
     disbelievers after you have believed, from selfish envy.." (2.109) 
<p>

     So the Prophet used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for them 
     as long as Allah ordered him to do so till Allah permitted fighting 
     them. So when Allah's Apostle fought the battle of Badr and Allah 
     killed the nobles of Quraish infidels through him, Ibn Ubai bin Salul 
     and the pagans and idolaters who were with him, said, "This matter 
     (i.e. Islam) has appeared (i.e. became victorious)." So they gave the 
     pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam) to Allah's Apostle and 
     became Muslims.

     Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want 
     now?' They will say, 'O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something
     to drink.' They will be directed and addressed thus, 'Will you drink,'

     said to them, 'You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a 
     wife or a son,' Then it will be said to them, 'What do you want?' They
     will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in
     the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allah (Alone, the 
     real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient. 
     Then (Allah) the Lord of the worlds will come to them in a shape 
     nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be 
     said, 'What are you waiting for?' Every nation have followed what they
     used to worship.' They will reply, 'We left the people in the world 
     when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as 
     friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.' 
     Allah will say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say twice or thrice, 'We 
     do not worship any besides Allah.' "

     Narrated Ibn 'Umar:
<p>

     That a man came to him (while two groups of Muslims were fighting) and
     said, "O Abu 'Abdur Rahman! Don't you hear what Allah has mentioned in
     His Book:
<p>

     'And if two groups of believers fight against each other...'  (49.9)
<p>

     So what prevents you from fighting as Allah has mentioned in His 
     Book?"' Ibn 'Umar said, "O son of my brother! I would rather be blamed
     for not fighting because of this Verse than to be blamed because of 
     another Verse where Allah says:
<p>

     'And whoever kills a believer intentionally..."  (4.93) Then that man 
     said, "Allah says:-- 'And fight them until there is no more 
     afflictions (worshipping other besides Allah) and the religion (i.e. 
     worship) will be all for Allah (Alone)"  (8.39) Ibn 'Umar said, "We 
     did this during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle when the number of 
     Muslims was small, and a man was put to trial because of his religion,
     the pagans would either kill or chain him; but when the Muslims 
     increased (and Islam spread), there was no persecution." When that man
     saw that Ibn 'Umar did not agree to his proposal, he said, "What is 
     your opinion regarding 'Ali and 'Uthman?" Ibn 'Umar said, "What is my 
     opinion regarding Ali and 'Uthman? As for 'Uthman, Allah forgave him 
     and you disliked to forgive him, and Ali is the cousin and son-in-law 
     of Allah's Apostle ." Then he pointed out with his hand and said, "And
     that is his daughter's (house) which you can see."

     offer a two-Rak'at prayer. The Prophet forbade others to speak to me 
     or to my two companions, but he did not prohibit speaking to any of 
     those who had remained behind excepting us. So the people avoided 
     speaking to us, and I stayed in that state till I could no longer bear
     it, and the only thing that worried me was that I might die and the 
     Prophet would not offer the funeral prayer for me, or Allah's Apostle 
     might die and I would be left in that social status among the people 
     that nobody would speak to me or offer the funeral prayer for me. But 
     Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us to the Prophet in the last third
     of the night while Allah's Apostle was with Um Salama. Um Salama 
     sympathized with me and helped me in my disaster. Allah's Apostle 
     said, 'O Um Salama! Ka'b has been forgiven!' She said, 'Shall I send 
     someone to him to give him the good tidings?' He said, 'If you did so,
     the people would not let you sleep the rest of the night.' So when the
     Prophet had offered the Fajr prayer, he announced Allah's Forgiveness 
     for us. His face used to look as bright as a piece of the (full) moon 
     whenever he was pleased. When Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us, 
     we were the three whose case had been deferred while the excuse 
     presented by those who had apologized had been accepted. But when 
     there were mentioned those who had told the Prophet lies and remained 
     behind (the battle of Tabuk) and had given false excuses, they were 
     described with the worse description one may be described with. Allah 
     said: 'They will present their excuses to you (Muslims) when you 
     return to them. Say: Present no excuses; we shall not believe you. 
     Allah has already informed us of the true state of matters concerning 
     you. Allah and His Apostle will observe your actions."  (9.94)

<p>

     who was one of those who used to write the Divine Revelation: Abu Bakr
     sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the 
     battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra' were killed). 'Umar 
     was present with Abu Bakr who said, 'Umar has come to me and said, The
     people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) 
     Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the 
     Qurra' (those who know the Qur'an by heart) at other battle-fields, 
     whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost, unless you collect it.
     And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur'an." Abu Bakr 
     added, "I said to 'Umar, 'How can I do something which Allah's Apostle
     has not done?' 'Umar said (to me), 'By Allah, it is (really) a good 
     thing.' So 'Umar kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his
     proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion
     as 'Umar." (Zaid bin Thabit added:) Umar was sitting with him (Abu 
     Bakr) and was not speaking. me). "You are a wise young man and we do 
     not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to
     write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle. Therefore, look for 
     the Qur'an and collect it (in one manuscript). " By Allah, if he (Abu 
     Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it
     would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me 
     concerning the collection of the Qur'an. I said to both of them, "How 
     dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?" Abu Bakr said, 
     "By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him 
     about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the 
     bosoms of Abu Bakr and Umar. So I started locating Quranic material 
     and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms 
     and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with 
     Khuzaima two Verses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with 
     anybody else, (and they were):--
<p>

     "Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst 
     yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or 
     difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly 
     guided)"  (9.128)
<p>

     The manuscript on which the Quran was collected, remained with Abu 
     Bakr till  Allah took him unto Him, and then with 'Umar till Allah 
     took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, Umar's 
     daughter.

     Some (cooked) meat was brought to Allah Apostle and the meat of a

     it and said, "I will be the chief of all the people on the Day of 
     Resurrection. Do you know the reason for it? Allah will gather all the
     human being of early generations as well as late generation on one 
     plain so that the announcer will be able to make them all-hear his 
     voice and the watcher will be able to see all of them. The sun will 
     come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and 
     trouble as they will not be able to bear or stand. Then the people 
     will say, 'Don't you see to what state you have reached? Won't you 
     look for someone who can intercede for you with your Lord' Some people
     will say to some others, 'Go to Adam.' So they will go to Adam and say
     to him. 'You are the father of mankind; Allah created you with His Own
     Hand, and breathed into you of His Spirit (meaning the spirit which he
     created for you); and ordered the angels to prostrate before you; so 
     (please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state 
     we are? Don't you see what condition we have reached?' Adam will say, 
     'Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become before, nor 
     will ever become thereafter. He forbade me (to eat of the fruit of) 
     the tree, but I disobeyed Him . Myself! Myself! Myself! (has more need
     for intercession). Go to someone else; go to Noah.' So they will go to
     Noah and say (to him), 'O Noah! You are the first (of Allah's 
     Messengers) to the people of the earth, and Allah has named you a 
     thankful slave; please intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see 
     in what state we are?' He will say.' Today my Lord has become angry as
     He has never become nor will ever become thereafter. I had (in the 
     world) the right to make one definitely accepted invocation, and I 
     made it against my nation. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else;
     go to Abraham.' They will go to Abraham and say, 'O Abraham! You are 
     Allah's Apostle and His Khalil from among the people of the earth; so 
     please intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we
     are?' He will say to them, 'My Lord has today become angry as He has 
     never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. I had told three
     lies (Abu Haiyan (the sub-narrator) mentioned them in the Hadith) 
     Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Moses.' The people 
     will then go to Moses and say, 'O Moses! You art Allah's Apostle and 
     Allah gave you superiority above the others with this message and with
     His direct Talk to you; (please) intercede for us with your Lord Don't
     you see in what state we are?' Moses will say, 'My Lord has today 
     become angry as He has never become before, nor will become 
     thereafter, I killed a person whom I had not been ordered to kill. 
     Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Jesus.' So they will
     go to Jesus and say, 'O Jesus! You are Allah's Apostle and His Word 
     which He sent to Mary, and a superior soul created by Him, and you 
     talked to the people while still young in the cradle. Please intercede
     for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we are?' Jesus will
     say. 'My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before nor
     will ever become thereafter. Jesus will not mention any sin, but will 
     say, 'Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muhammad.' So 
     they will come to me and say, 'O Muhammad ! You are Allah's Apostle 
     and the last of the prophets, and Allah forgave your early and late 
     sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what 
     state we are?" The Prophet added, "Then I will go beneath Allah's 
     Throne and fall in prostration before my Lord. And then Allah will 
     guide me to such praises and glorification to Him as He has never 
     guided anybody else before me. Then it will be said, 'O Muhammad Raise
     your head. Ask, and it will be granted. Intercede It (your 
     intercession) will be accepted.' So I will raise my head and Say, 'My 
     followers, O my Lord! My followers, O my Lord'. It will be said, 'O 
     Muhammad! Let those of your followers who have no accounts, enter 
     through such a gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; and
     they will share the other gates with the people." The Prophet further 
     said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance between every two
     gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Busra 
     (in Sham)."

     Narrated Said bin Jubair:
<p>

     I said to Ibn 'Abbas, "Nauf Al-Bikali claims that Moses, the companion
     of Al-Khadir was not the Moses of the children of Israel" Ibn 'Abbas 
     said, "The enemy of Allah (Nauf) told a lie." Narrated Ubai bin Ka'b 
     that he heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Moses got up to deliver a 
     speech before the children of Israel and he was asked, Who is the most
     learned person among the people?' Moses replied, 'I (am the most 
     learned).' Allah admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to 
     Allah alone. So Allah revealed to him: 'At the junction of the two 
     seas there is a slave of Ours who is more learned than you.' Moses 
     asked, 'O my Lord, how can I meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish and 
     put it in a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, 
     you will find him.' So Moses (took a fish and put it in a basket and) 
     set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha' bin Nun, till they reached 
     a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved 
     vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and 
     there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel). 
     (18.61) Allah stopped the current of water on both sides of the way 
     created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Moses got
     up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they 
     carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole 
     night. 
<p>

     The next morning Moses asked his boy-servant 'Bring us our early meal;
     no doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.'  
     (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place which 
     Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to 
     him,' 'Do you remember when we be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed 
     forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took
     its course into the sea in a marvelous way.'    (18.63)
<p>

     There was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant 
     there was astonishment. Moses said, 'That is what we have been 
     seeking'. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They 
     both returned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. 
     Behold ! There they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted 
     him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. 'Is there such a greeting in your 
     land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' He said, 'Are you the Moses of the 
     children of Israel?' Moses said, 'I have come to you so that you may 
     teach me of what you have been taught.
<p>

     Al-Khadir said, 'You will not be able to have patience with me.   
     (18.66) O Moses! I have some of Allah's knowledge which He has 
     bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some of 
     Allah's knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know 
     it." Moses said, "Allah willing, you will find me patient, and I will 
     not disobey you in anything.'   (18.6) Al-Khadir said to him. 'If you 
     then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to 
     you concerning it.' (18.70), After that both of them proceeded along 
     the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested the crew to 
     let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them 
     to get on board free of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses 
     saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the planks of the boat with 
     an adze. Moses said to him.' These people gave us a free lift, yet you
     have scuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have 
     done a dreadful thing.'   (18.71)
<p>

     Al-Khadir said, 'Didn't I say that you can have no patience with me ?'
     (18.72) Moses said, 'Call me not to account for what I forgot and be 
     not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)"     (18.73)
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "The first excuse given by Moses, was that he 
     had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the boat 
     and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, 'My 
     knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Allah's knowledge is like 
     what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.' Then they both got out of
     the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, Al-Khadir saw 
     a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that 
     boy and pulled it out with his hands and killed him. Moses said, 'Have
     you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody! Truly, you have 
     done an illegal thing.' (18.74) He said, "Didn't I tell you that you 
     can have no patience with me?' (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the 
     second blame was stronger than the first one.) Moses said, 'If I ask 
     you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have 
     received an excuse from me.'   (18.76)
<p>

     Then they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town.
     They asked them food but they refused to entertain them. (In that 
     town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down.  (18.77) 
     Al-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, 'These 
     are people to whom we came, but they neither fed us nor received us as
     guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some 
     recompense for it. Al-Khadir said, 'This is the parting between me and
     you ..that is the interpretation of (those things) over which you were
     unable to hold patience.'    (18.78-82)
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "We wished that Moses could have been more 
     patient so that Allah might have described to us more about their 
     story."

     Allah said, "That place will be where the fish will leave you." Ya'la 
     said to me, "Allah said (to Moses), 'Take a dead fish (and your goal 
     will be) the place where it will become alive.' " So Moses took a fish
     and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant "I don't want to 
     trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish 
     leaves you." He said (to Moses)." You have not demanded too much." And
     that is as mentioned by Allah:
<p>

     'And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant .... ' (18.60) Yusha'
     bin Nun. (Said did not state that). The Prophet said, "While the 
     attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish 
     slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to 
     himself), "I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell
     him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow 
     of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was 
     made on a rock. 'Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index 
     fingers, said to me, "Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock." 
     Moses said "We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours." 
     (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found 
     Al-Khadir. 'Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a 
     green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his 
     garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. 
     When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, 'Is 
     there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?' Moses said, 'I am 
     Moses.' Al-Khadir said, 'Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses 
     said, 'Yes.' Al-Khadir said, "What do you want?' Moses said, ' I came 
     to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.' 
     Al-Khadir said, 'Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in 
     your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I
     have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge 
     which I ought not learn.' At that time a bird took with its beak (some
     water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, 'By Allah, my knowledge and 
     your knowledge besides Allah's Knowledge is like what this bird has 
     taken with its beak from the sea.' Until, when they went on board the 
     boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people 
     from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized 
     Al-Khadir and said, 'The pious slave of Allah.' (We said to Said "Was 
     that Khadir?" He said, "Yes.") The boat men said, 'We will not get him
     on board with fare.' Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the 
     hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, 'Have you scuttle it in order to
     drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) 
     (Mujahid said. "Moses said so protestingly.") Al-Khadir said, didn't I
     say that you can have no patience with me?' (18.72) The first inquiry 
     of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to
     be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. 
     Moses said, 'Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard 
     upon me for my affair (with you).'  (18.73)
<p>

     (Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya'la- said: Said 
     said 'They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome 
     infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, 
     'Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody' (18.74) Then 
     they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling 
     down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Said moved his hand thus and 
     said 'Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya'la 
     said, 'I think Said said, 'Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand 
     and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), 'If you had wished, 
     you could have taken wages for it. Said said, 'Wages that we might had
     eaten.' And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them" (18.79)  And 
     there was in front of them. Ibn 'Abbas recited: 'In front of them 
     (was) a king.'
<p>

     It is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the king 
     was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. 'A king 
     who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat 
     passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they 
     have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people 
     said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar.
     'His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and 
     we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion 
     and disbelief.' (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them 
     to follow him in his religion, 'so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord
     should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to
     mercy' (18:81). This was in reply to Moses' saying: Have you killed an
     innocent soul.'? (18.74). 'Near to mercy" means they will be more 
     merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. 
     Other than Sa'id, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud 
     bin Abi 'Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next 
     child was a girl.

     Narrated Said bin Jubair:
<p>

     I said to Ibn 'Abbas, "Nauf-al-Bakali " claims that Moses of Bani 
     Israel was not Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir." Ibn 'Abbas said, 
     "Allah's enemy tells a lie! Ubai bin Ka'b narrated to us that Allah's 
     Apostle said, 'Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and
     he was asked, 'Who is the most learned person among the people?' Moses
     replied, 'I (am the most learned).' Allah then admonished Moses for he
     did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah only (Then) came the Divine 
     Inspiration:-- 'Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas
     is more learned than you.'
<p>

     Moses said, 'O my Lord ! How can meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish 
     in a basket and wherever the fish is lost, follow it (you will find 
     him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant Yusha' 
     bin Nun, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock 
     and rested there. Moses put his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a 
     sub-narrator said that somebody other than 'Amr said) 'At the rock 
     there was a water spring called 'Al-Hayat' and none came in touch with
     its water but became alive. So some of the water of that spring fell 
     over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket and entered 
     the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, 'Bring our early 
     meal' (18.62). 
<p>

     The narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he 
     had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His attendant 
     Yusha bin Nun said to him, 'Do you remember (what happened) when we 
     betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish 
     ...' (18.63) The narrator added: So they came back, retracing their 
     steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the fish looking like
     a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and 
     there was tunnel for the fish. When they reached the rock, they found 
     a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. The man said 
     astonishingly, 'Is there any such greeting in your land?' Moses said, 
     'I am Moses.' The man said, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes,'
     and added, 'may I follow you so that you teach me something of the 
     Knowledge which you have been taught?' (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him,
     'O Moses! You have something of Allah's knowledge which Allah has 
     taught you and which I do not know; and I have something of Allah's 
     knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.' Moses 
     said, 'But I will follow you.' Al-Khadir said, 'Then if you follow me,
     ask me no question about anything until I myself speak to you 
     concerning it.'  (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along the 
     seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir 
     and received them on board free of charge. So they both got on board. 
     A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak 
     unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. 'My knowledge and your 
     knowledge and all the creation's knowledge compared to Allah's 
     knowledge is not more than the water taken by this sparrow's beak.' 
<p>

     Then Moses was startled by Al-Khadir's action of taking an adze and 
     scuttling the boat with it. Moses said to him, 'These people gave us a
     free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown 
     them. Surely you have...'    (18.71) Then they both proceeded and 
     found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the
     head and cut it off. Moses said to him, 'Have you killed an innocent 
     soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! '  
     (18.74) He said, "Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to have 
     patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain them as their 
     guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.'  
     (18.75-77) Al-Khadir moved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired 
     it). Moses said to him, 'When we entered this town, they neither gave 
     us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken 
     wages for it,' Al-Khadir said, 'This is the parting between you and me
     I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) about which you 
     were unable to hold patience.'...(18.78)
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, 'We wished that Moses could have been more 
     patient so that He (Allah) could have described to us more about their
     story.' Ibn 'Abbas used to recite:-- 'And in front (ahead) of them 
     there was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force. 
     (18.79) ...and as for the boy he was a disbeliever. "

     'Uwaimir came to 'Asim bin 'Adi who was the chief of Bani Ajlan and 
     said, "What do you say about a man who has found another man with his 
     wife? Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (i.e. the 
     husband), or what should he do? Please ask Allah's Apostle about this 
     matter on my behalf." Asim then went to the Prophet and said, "O 
     Allah's Apostle! (And asked him that question) but Allah's Apostle 
     disliked the question," When 'Uwaimir asked 'Asim (about the Prophet's
     answer) 'Asim replied that Allah's Apostle disliked such questions and
     considered it shameful. "Uwaimir then said, "By Allah, I will not give
     up asking unless I ask Allah's Apostle about it." Uwaimir came (to the
     Prophet ) and said, "O Allah's Apostle! A man has found another man 
     with his wife! Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (the 
     husband, in Qisas) or what should he do?" Allah's Apostle said, "Allah
     has revealed regarding you and your wife's case in the Qur'an "So 
     Allah's Apostle ordered them to perform the measures of Mula'ana 
     according to what Allah had mentioned in His Book. So 'Uwaimir did 
     Mula'ana with her and said, "O Allah's Apostle! If I kept her I would 
     oppress her." So 'Uwaimir divorced her and so divorce became a 
     tradition after them for those who happened to be involved in a case 
     of Mula'ana. Allah's Apostle then said, "Look! If she (Uwaimir's wife)
     delivers a black child with deep black large eyes, big hips and fat 
     legs, then I will be of the opinion that 'Uwaimir has spoken the 
     truth; but if she delivers a red child looking like a Wahra then we 
     will consider that 'Uwaimir has told a lie against her." Later on she 
     delivered a child carrying the qualities which Allah's Apostle had 
     mentioned as a proof for 'Uwaimir's claim; therefore the child was 
     ascribed to its mother henceforth.

     Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife of committing illegal sexual

     Prophet. The Prophet said (to Hilal), "Either you bring forth a proof 
     (four witnesses) or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on 
     your back." Hilal said, "O Allah's Apostle! If anyone of us saw a man 
     over his wife, would he go to seek after witnesses?" The Prophet kept 
     on saying, "Either you bring forth the witnesses or you will receive 
     the legal punishment (lashes) on your back." Hilal then said, "By Him

     Prophet was saying, "Allah knows that one of you is a liar, so will 
     any of you repent?" Then the woman got up and took the oaths and when 
     she was going to take the fifth one, the people stopped her and said, 
     "It (the fifth oath) will definitely bring Allah's curse on you (if 
     you are guilty)." So she hesitated and recoiled (from taking the oath)
     so much that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But then

     Narrated Aisha:
<p>

     (The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah's Apostle intended to go on a
     journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him 
     the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted 
     to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with 
     Allah's Apostle after Allah's order of veiling (the women) had been 
     revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and 
     dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when 
     Allah's Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached
     Medina, Allah's Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was
     ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I 
     left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I
     went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz 
     Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my 
     search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, 
     came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was 
     riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light 
     in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so 
     those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it
     up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and 
     proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to
     their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I 
     used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my 
     search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. 
     Safwan bin Al-Mu'attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He
     had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing 
     place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came 
     to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before 
     veiling. I got up because of his saying: "Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi 
     rajiun," which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my
     garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, 
     "Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun," till he made his she-camel kneel
     down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan 
     set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the 
     army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was 
     meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk 
     (forged statement) was 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we 
     arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were
     spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was 
     not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was 
     sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allah's Apostle the same
     kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah's Apostle would 
     enter upon me, say a greeting and add, "How is that (lady)?" and then 
     depart. 
<p>

     That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil 
     till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer 
     the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to 
     relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from
     night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our 
     houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old 
     'Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of 
     the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take 
     lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the 
     daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of 
     Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was
     Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I 
     came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon
     she said, "Let Mistah be ruined ! " I said to her, "What a bad word 
     you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of 
     Badr?' She said, "O you there! Didn't you hear what he has said?" I 
     said, "And what did he say?" She then told me the statement of the 
     people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I
     returned home, Allah's Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he 
     said, "How is that (lady)?" I said, "Will you allow me to go to my 
     parents?" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them.
     Allah's Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my 
     mother, "O my mother! What are the people talking about?" My mother 
     said, "O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming
     lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that
     those wives would find fault with her." I said, "Subhan Allah! Did the
     people really talk about that?" 
<p>

     That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My 
     tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was 
     still weeping, Allah's Apostle called 'Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin
     Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as 
     to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allah's Apostle
     of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection 
     he kept for her. He said, "O Allah's Apostle! She is your wife, and we
     do not know anything about her except good." But 'Ali bin Abi Talib 
     said, "O Allah's Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; 
     and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask 
     (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth." 'Aisha added: So 
     Allah's Apostle called for Barira and said, "O Barira! Did you ever 
     see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards 
     Aisha). Barira said, "By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have
     never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except
     that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the
     dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and 
     eat it." So Allah's Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked
     for somebody who would take revenge on 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul 
     then. Allah's Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, "O Muslims! Who will
     help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By 
     Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have 
     blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to 
     visit my family except with me," Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and 
     said, "O Allah's Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he
     be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and
     if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order 
     and we will obey it." On that, Sad bin 'Ubada got up, and he was the 
     chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man
     but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sad (bin 
     Muadh), "By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill
     him and you will never be able to kill him!" On that, Usaid bin 
     Hudair, the cousin of Sad (bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin 
     'Ubada, "You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill 
     him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!" So the two 
     tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the 
     point of fighting with each other while Allah's Apostle was standing 
     on the pulpit. Allah's Apostle continued quietening them till they 
     became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on 
     weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In 
     the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and
     a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that
     my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was 
     weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her 
     and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, 
     Allah's Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat 
     with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month 
     without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allah's 
     Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, 
     "Thereafter, O 'Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing 
     about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, 
     and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's forgiveness and 
     repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to 
     Allah, Allah accepts his repentance." When Allah's Apostle had 
     finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer 
     felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, "Reply to Allah's 
     Apostle on my behalf as to what he said." He said, "By Allah, I do not
     know what to say to Allah's Apostle." Then I said to my mother, "Reply
     to Allah's Apostle."
<p>

     She said, "I do not know what to say to Allah's Apostle." Still a 
     young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I 
     said, "By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much
     so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So
     now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am 
     innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and 
     Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I
     cannot find of you an example except that of Joseph's father: "So (for
     me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is 
     Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on 
     my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah 
     would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah 
     would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be 
     recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of
     by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that 
     Allah's Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my 
     innocence. By Allah, Allah's Apostle had not left his seat and nobody 
     had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Apostle
     . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake
     him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat 
     were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and
     that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed 
     to him. When that state of Allah's Apostle was over, and he was 
     smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, "Aisha, 
     Allah has declared your innocence." My mother said to me, "Get up and 
     go to him." I said, "By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not 
     thank anybody but Allah." So Allah revealed: "Verily! They who spread 
     the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not...." (24.11-20).
<p>

     When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq 
     who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latter's 
     kinship to him and his poverty, said, "By Allah, I will never provide 
     for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha". So Allah 
     revealed:
<p>

     "Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to 
     give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left 
     their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do 
     not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily 
     Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful." (24.22)
<p>

     Abu Bakr said, "Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me." 
     So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and 
     said, "By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all." Aisha 
     further said: Allah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my 
     case. He said, "O Zainab! What have you seen?" She replied, "O Allah's
     Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling
     lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha)." Of all the wives of 
     Allah's Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the 
     same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling 
     lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on
     her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread 
     the slander.

     Narrated Aisha:
<p>

     When there was said about me what was said which I myself was unaware 
     of, Allah's Apostle got up and addressed the people. He recited 
     Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he
     said, "To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those 
     people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not 
     know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused her of being with 
     a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered
     my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey,
     he went with me." Sad bin Mu'adh got up and said, "O Allah's Apostle 
     Allow me to chop their heads off" Then a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa'd
     bin 'Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin Thabit was a 
     relative, got up and said (to Sad bin Mu'adh), "You have told a lie! 
     By Allah, if those persons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like
     to chop their heads off." It was probable that some evil would take 
     place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware
     of all that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my 
     needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um Mistah was accompanying me. On 
     our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, "Let Mistah. be ruined" I 
     said to her, "O mother Why do you abuse your Son" On that Um Mistah 
     became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, "Let Mistah 
     be ruined" I said to her, "Why do you abuse your son?" She stumbled 
     for the third time and said, "Let Mistah be ruined" whereupon I 
     rebuked her for that. She said, "By Allah, I do not abuse him except 
     because of you." I asked her, "Concerning what of my affairs?" So she 
     disclosed the whole story to me. I said, "Has this really happened?" 
     She replied, "Yes, by Allah." I returned to my house, astonished (and 
     distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then 
     I became sick (fever) and said to Allah's Apostle "Send me to my 
     father's house." So he sent a slave with me, and when I entered the 
     house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my father) Abu 
     Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, "What has 
     brought you, O (my) daughter?" I informed her and mentioned to her the
     whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, "O my 
     daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by 
     her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of her and 
     speak badly of her." But she did not feel the news as I did. I asked 
     (her), "Does my father know about it?" She said, "yes" I asked, Does 
     Allah's Apostle know about it too?" She said, "Yes, Allah's Apostle 
     does too." So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was 
     reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, 
     "What is the matter with her? " She said, "She has heard what has been
     said about her (as regards the story of Al-lfk)." On that Abu- Bakr 
     wept and said, "I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to 
     your home" I went back to my home and Allah's Apostle had come to my 
     house and asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The 
     maid-servant said, "By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her 
     character except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) 
     and eat her dough." On that, some of the Prophet's companions spoke 
     harshly to her and said, "Tell the truth to Allah's Apostle." Finally 
     they told her of the affair (of the slander). She said, "Subhan Allah!
     By Allah, I know nothing against her except what goldsmith knows about
     a piece of pure gold." Then this news reached the man who was accused,
     and he said, "Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the 
     private parts of any woman." Later that man was martyred in Allah's 
     Cause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed 
     with me till Allah's Apostle came to me after he had offered the Asr 
     prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on my 
     right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, "Now then 
     O 'Aisha! If you have committed a bad deed or you have wronged 
     (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the repentance from 
     his slaves." An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the 
     gate. I said (to the Prophet). "Isn't it improper that you speak in 
     such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah's Apostle then gave a 
     piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer 
     him (on my behalf). My father said, "What should I say?" Then I turned
     to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, "What should I 
     say?" When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, "I 
     testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and 
     that Muhammad is His Apostle!" And after praising and glorifying Allah
     as He deserves, I said, "Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell you 
     that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I 
     am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part 
     because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have 
     absorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and 
     Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say, 'She has 
     confessed herself guilty." By Allah, 'I do not see a suitable example 
     for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob's name 
     but couldn't) Joseph's father when he said; So (for me) "Patience is 
     most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose 
     help can be sought.' At that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to 
     Allah's Apostle and we remained silent. Then the Inspiration was over 
     and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing
     (the sweat) from his forehead and saying, "Have the good tidings O ' 
     "Aisha! Allah has revealed your innocence." At that time I was 
     extremely angry. My parents said to me. "Get up and go to him." I 
     said, "By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank 
     either of you, but I will thank Allah Who has revealed my innocence. 
     You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it 
     (to defend me)," (Aisha used to say:) "But as regards Zainab bint 
     Jahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Allah protected her because of her piety,
     so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, 
     Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak
     evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, 
     Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and tempt others to 
     speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share 
     therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor to 
     Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse:--   
<p>

     "Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) 
     swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those in 
     need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? 
     And Allah if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (24.22) 
<p>

     On that, Abu Bakr said, "Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You 
     should forgive us." So Abu Bakr again started giving to Mistah the 
     expenditure which he used to give him before.

     While a man was delivering a speech in the tribe of Kinda, he said, 
     "Smoke will prevail on the Day of Resurrection and will deprive the 
     hypocrites their faculties of hearing and seeing. The believers will 
     be afflicted with something like cold only thereof." That news scared 
     us, so I went to (Abdullah) Ibn Mas'ud while he was reclining (and 
     told him the story) whereupon he became angry, sat up and said, "He 
     who knows a thing can say, it, but if he does not know, he should say,
     'Allah knows best,' for it is an aspect of knowledge to say, 'I do not
     know,' if you do not know a certain thing. Allah said to His prophet. 
     'Say (O Muhammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur'an), nor I am
     one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not 
     exist.)' (38.86)
<p>

     The Qur'aish delayed in embracing Islam for a period, so the Prophet 
     invoked evil on them, saying, 'O Allah! Help me against them by 
     sending seven years of (famine) like those of Joseph.' So they were 
     afflicted with such a severe year of famine that they were destroyed 
     therein and ate dead animals and bones. They started seeing something 
     like smoke between the sky and the earth (because of severe hunger). 
     Abu Sufyan then came (to the Prophet) and said, "O Muhammad! You came 
     to order us for to keep good relations with Kith and kin, and your 
     kinsmen have now perished, so please invoke Allah (to relieve them).' 
     Then Ibn Mas'ud recited:-- 'Then watch you for the day that the sky 
     will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible....but truly you will
     return! (to disbelief) (44.10-15)
<p>

     Ibn Mas'ud added, Then the punishment was stopped, but truly, they 
     reverted to heathenism (their old way). So Allah (threatened them 
     thus): 'On the day when we shall seize you with a mighty grasp.'  
     (44.16) And that was the day of the Battle of Badr. Allah's saying- 
     "Lizama" (the punishment) refers to the day of Badr Allah's 
     Statement:
<p>

     'Alif-Lam-Mim, the Romans have been defeated, and they, after their 
     defeat, will be victorious,' (30.1-3) (This verse): Indicates that the

     One day while Allah's Apostle was sitting with the people, a man came

     Prophet said, "Belief is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, 
     His Apostles, and the meeting with Him, and to believe in the 
     Resurrection." The man asked, "O Allah's Apostle What is Islam?" The 
     Prophet replied, "Islam is to worship Allah and not worship anything 
     besides Him, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay the (compulsory) 
     charity i.e. Zakat and to fast the month of Ramadan." The man again 
     asked, "O Allah's Apostle What is Ihsan (i.e. perfection or 
     Benevolence)?" The Prophet said, "Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you 
     see Him, and if you do not achieve this state of devotion, then (take 
     it for granted that) Allah sees you." The man further asked, "O 
     Allah's Apostle When will the Hour be established?"
<p>

     The Prophet replied, "The one who is asked about it does not know more
     than the questioner does, but I will describe to you its portents. 
     When the lady slave gives birth to her mistress, that will be of its 
     portents; when the bare-footed naked people become the chiefs of the 
     people, that will be of its portents. The Hour is one of five things 
     which nobody knows except Allah. Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is 
     with Allah (alone). He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in
     the wombs."  (31.34) Then the man left. The Prophet said, "Call him 
     back to me." They went to call him back but could not see him. The 
     Prophet said, "That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their 
     religion." (See Hadith No. 47 Vol 1)

     worshipers such things as no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard 
     of, and nobody has ever thought of. All that is reserved, besides 
     which, all that you have seen, is nothing." Then he recited:--

     'No soul knows what is kept hidden (in reserve) for them of joy as a 
     reward for what they used to do.' (32.17)

     (effectual) reminder for them when an Apostle, explaining things

     and said: 'One taught (by a human being), a madman?' 'We shall indeed 
     remove punishment for a while, but truly, you will revert (to 
     disbelief).' (44.12-15)  Will the punishment be removed on the Day of

     It (i.e., the imagined smoke) was because, when the Quraish refused to

     similar to those of (Prophet) Joseph. So they were stricken with 
     famine and fatigue, so much so that they ate even bones. A man would 
     look towards the sky and imagine seeing something like smoke between 
     him and the sky because of extreme fatigue. So Allah revealed:--
<p>

     'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of 
     smoke plainly visible, covering the people; this is a painfull of 
     torment.' (44.10-11)
<p>

     Then someone (Abu Sufyan) came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's
     Apostle! Invoke Allah to send rain for the tribes of Mudar for they 
     are on the verge of destruction." On that the Prophet said 
     (astonishingly) "Shall I invoke Allah) for the tribes of Mudar? 
     Verily, you are a brave man!" But the Prophet prayed for rain and it 
     rained for them. Then the Verse was revealed.
<p>

     'But truly you will return (to disbelief).'  (44.15) (When the famine 
     was over and) they restored prosperity and welfare, they reverted to 
     their ways (of heathenism) whereupon Allah revealed:
<p>

     'On the Day when We shall seize you with a Mighty Grasp. We will 
     indeed (then) exact retribution.'  (44.16) The narrator said, "That

     I went to Abu Wail to ask him (about those who had rebelled against

     of the Euphrates, the place where me battle took place between 'Ali 
     and Muawiya) A man said, "Will you be on the side of those who are 
     called to consult Allah's Book (to settle the dispute)?" 'Ali said, 
     'Yes (I agree that we should settle the matter in the light of the 
     Qur'an)." ' Some people objected to 'Ali's agreement and wanted to 
     fight. On that Sahl bin Hunaif said, 'Blame yourselves! I remember 
     how, on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (i.e. the peace treaty between the 
     Prophet and the Quraish pagans), if we had been allowed to choose 
     fighting, we would have fought (the pagans). At that time 'Umar came 
     (to the Prophet) and said, "Aren't we on the right (path) and they 
     (pagans) in the wrong? Won't our killed persons go to Paradise, and 
     theirs in the Fire?" The Prophet replied, "Yes." Umar further said, 
     "Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before 
     Allah has settled the matter between us?" The Prophet said, "O the son
     of Al-Khattab! No doubt, I am Allah's Apostle and Allah will never 
     neglect me." So Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient 
     that he went to Abu Bakr and said, "O Abu Bakr! Aren't we on the right

<p>

     For the whole year I had the desire to ask 'Umar bin Al-Khattab 
     regarding the explanation of a Verse (in Surat Al-Tahrim) but I could 
     not ask him because I respected him very much. When he went to perform
     the Hajj, I too went along with him. On our return, while we were 
     still on the way home. 'Umar went aside to answer the call of nature 
     by the Arak trees. I waited till he finished and then I proceeded with
     him and asked him. "O chief of the Believers! Who were the two wives 
     of the Prophet who aided one another against him?" He said, "They were
     Hafsa and 'Aisha." Then I said to him, "By Allah, I wanted to ask you 
     about this a year ago, but I could not do so owing to my respect for 
     you." 'Umar said, "Do not refrain from asking me. If you think that I 
     have knowledge (about a certain matter), ask me; and if I know 
     (something about it), I will tell you." Then Umar added, "By Allah, in
     the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women 
     until Allah revealed regarding them what He revealed regarding them 
     and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was thinking 
     over a certain matter, my wife said, "I recommend that you do 
     so-and-so." I said to her, "What have you got to do with the is 
     matter? Why do you poke your nose in a matter which I want to see 
     fulfilled.?" She said, How strange you are, O son of Al-Khattab! You 
     don't want to be argued with whereas your daughter, Hafsa surely, 
     argues with Allah's Apostle so much that he remains angry for a full 
     day!" 'Umar then reported; how he at once put on his outer garment and
     went to Hafsa and said to her, "O my daughter! Do you argue with 
     Allah's Apostle so that he remains angry the whole day?" H. afsa said,
     "By Allah, we argue with him." 'Umar said, "Know that I warn you of 
     Allah's punishment and the anger of Allah's Apostle . . . O my 
     daughter! Don't be betrayed by the one who is proud of her beauty 
     because of the love of Allah's Apostle for her (i.e. 'Aisha)." 'Umar 
     addled, "Then I went out to Um Salama's house who was one of my 
     relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It is 
     rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to 
     interfere between Allah's Apostle and his wives!' By Allah, by her 
     talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. I left 
     her (and went home). At that time I had a friend from the Ansar who 
     used to bring news (from the Prophet) in case of my absence, and I 
     used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were 
     afraid of one of the kings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended
     to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts because of that. (One
     day) my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, "Open
     Open!' I said, 'Has the king of Ghassan come?' He said, 'No, but 
     something worse; Allah's Apostle has isolated himself from his wives.'
     I said, 'Let the nose of 'Aisha and Hafsa be stuck to dust (i.e. 
     humiliated)!' Then I put on my clothes and went to Allah's Apostle's 
     residence, and behold, he was staying in an upper room of his to which
     he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Allah's Apostle was 
     (sitting) on the first step. I said to him, 'Say (to the Prophet ) 
     'Umar bin Al-Khattab is here.' Then the Prophet admitted me and I 
     narrated the story to Allah's Apostle. When I reached the story of Um 
     Salama, Allah's Apostle smiled while he was lying on a mat made of 
     palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. Underneath his 
     head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves 
     of a saut tree were piled at his feet, and above his head hung a few 
     water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted on his side, I 
     wept. He said.' 'Why are you weeping?' I replied, "O Allah's Apostle! 
     Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e. Luxurious life) while 
     you, Allah's Apostle though you are, is living in destitute". The 
     Prophet then replied. 'Won't you be satisfied that they enjoy this 
     world and we the Hereafter?' "

     Narrated Aisha:
<p>

     (the wife of the Prophet) The commencement (of the Divine Inspiration)
     to Allah's Apostle was in the form of true dreams in his sleep, for he
     never had a dream but it turned out to be true and clear as the bright
     daylight. Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in 
     seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship Allah 
     continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take 
     the necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his 
     wife) Khadija again to take his provision (of food) likewise, till one
     day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. An 
     Angel came to him and asked him to read. Allah's Apostle replied, "I 
     do not know how to read." The Prophet added, "Then the Angel held me 
     (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. Then he 
     released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, 'I do not know 
     how to read.' Thereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second
     time till I felt distressed. He then released me and asked me to read,
     but again I replied. 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he held me
     for the third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he 
     released me and said, 'Read, in the Name of your Lord Who has created 
     (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your Lord 
     is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has 
     taught man that which he knew not."   (96.1-5).
<p>

     Then Allah's Apostle returned with that experience; and the muscles 
     between his neck and shoulders were trembling till he came upon 
     Khadija (his wife) and said, "Cover me!" They covered him, and when 
     the state of fear was over, he said to Khadija, "O Khadija! What is 
     wrong with me? I was afraid that something bad might happen to me." 
     Then he told her the story. Khadija said, "Nay! But receive the good 
     tidings! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you, for by Allah, you 
     keep good relations with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the 
     poor and the destitute, entertain your guests generously and assist 
     those who are stricken with calamities." Khadija then took him to 
     Waraqa bin Naufil, the son of Khadija's paternal uncle. Waraqa had 
     been converted to Christianity in the Pre-lslamic Period and used to 
     write Arabic and write of the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished
     him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija 
     said (to Waraqa), "O my cousin! Listen to what your nephew is going to
     say." Waraqa said, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" The Prophet then
     described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same Angel 
     (Gabriel) who was sent to Moses. I wish I were young." He added some 
     other statement. Allah's Apostle asked, "Will these people drive me 
     out?" Waraqa said, "Yes, for nobody brought the like of what you have 
     brought, but was treated with hostility. If I were to remain alive 
     till your day (when you start preaching). then I would support you 
     strongly." But a short while later Waraqa died and the Divine 
     Inspiration was paused (stopped) for a while so that Allah's Apostle 
     was very much grieved.
<p>

     Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah: While Allah's Apostle was talking about 
     the period of pause in revelation. he said in his narration. "Once 
     while I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I 
     looked up and saw to my surprise, the same Angel as had visited me in 
     the cave of Hira.' He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the 
     earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, Wrap me! Wrap 
     me!" So they covered him and then Allah revealed:
<p>

     'O you, wrapped up! Arise and warn and your Lord magnify, and your 
     garments purify and dessert the idols.'   (74.1-5)
<p>

     Abu Salama said, "(Rijz) are the idols which the people of the 
     Pre-lslamic period used to worship." After this the revelation started
     coming frequently and regularly.

     (The sub-narrator) Qatada added: I have been informed that the Prophet
     recited: 'Those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture," 
     ...to Ubai.

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, " Horses are kept for one of three purposes: A  
     man may keep them (for Allah's Cause) to receive a reward in the 
     Hereafter; another may keep them as a means of protection; and a third
     may keep them to be a burden for him. As for the man for whom the 
     horse is a source of reward, he is the one who ties it for Allah's 
     Cause, and he ties it with a long rope in a pasture or a garden, then,
     whatever it eats or drinks in that pasture or garden will be added to 
     his good deeds. And if it breaks its rope and jumps over one or two 
     hills, then, for all its footsteps and its manure, good deeds will be 
     written for him. And if it passes by a river and drinks of its water 
     though its owner had no intention to water it from that river, even 
     then he will have good deeds written for him. So that horse will be (a
     source of) reward for such a man.
<p>

     If a man ties a horse for earning his livelihood and abstaining from 
     asking others for help and he does not forget Allah's right, i.e. pays
     its Zakat and gives it to be used in Allah's Cause, then that horse 
     will be a means of protection for him. But if a man ties it out of 
     pride and to show off and to excite others, then that horse will be a 
     burden (of sins) for him." Then Allah's Apostle was asked regarding 
     donkeys. He replied, "Nothing has been revealed to me except this 
     comprehensive Verse which includes everything:
<p>

     'So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest 
     ant) shall see it; and whoever does evil equal to the weight of an 
     atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it.' (99.7-8)
