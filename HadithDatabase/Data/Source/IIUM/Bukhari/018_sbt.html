<p>

     We were with Allah's Apostle when the sun eclipsed. Allah's Apostle 
     stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the Mosque. He led us in a
     two-Rakat prayer till the sun (eclipse) had cleared. Then the Prophet 
     (p.b.u.h) said, "The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of 
     someone's death. So whenever you see these eclipses pray and invoke 
     (Allah) till the eclipse is over."

     In the life-time of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed, so he 
     led the people in prayer, and stood up and performed a long Qiyam, 
     then bowed for a long while. He stood up again and performed a long 
     Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first.
     He bowed again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he
     prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the 
     second Raka as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by 
     then the sun (eclipse) had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) 
     and after praising and glorifying Allah he said, "The sun and the moon
     are two signs against the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the 
     death or life of anyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah 
     and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa." The Prophet then said, "O 
     followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has more ghaira 
     (self-respect) than Allah as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or
     female commit adultery (illegal sexual intercourse). O followers of 
     Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that which I know you would laugh 
     little and weep much.

     did not prostrate but stood up and recited a prolonged recitation 
     which was shorter than the first recitation. He again said Takbir and

     had cleared before he finished the prayer. (After the prayer) he stood
     up, glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and then said, "The sun
     and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse

     to the period in which one could recite Surat-al-Baqara. Then he bowed

     nor because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember 
     Allah." The people say, "O Allah's Apostle! We saw you taking 
     something from your place and then we saw you retreating." The Prophet
     replied, "I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of 
     its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long 
     as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen 
     such a horrible sight. I saw that most of the inhabitants were women."
     The people asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Why is it so?" The Prophet 
     replied, "Because of their ungratefulness." It was asked whether they 
     are ungrateful to Allah. The Prophet said, "They are ungrateful to 
     their companions of life (husbands) and ungrateful to good deeds. If 
     you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees 
     anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, 'I have never had any 
     good from you.' "

     offering the prayer and she was also praying too. I asked her, 'What 
     has happened to the people?' She pointed out with her hand towards the
     sky and said, 'Subhan-Allah'. I said, 'Is there a sign?' She pointed 
     out in the affirmative." Asma' further said, "I too then stood up for

     and said, 'I have seen at this place of mine what I have never seen
