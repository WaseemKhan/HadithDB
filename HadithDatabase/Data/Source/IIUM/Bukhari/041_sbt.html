     Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the mountain 
     of Uhud and said, "I would not like to have this mountain turned into 
     gold for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of 
     it with me for more than three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in 
     Allah's Cause), except that Dinar which I will keep for repaying 
     debts." Then he said, "Those who are rich in this world would have 
     little reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here
     and there (in Allah's Cause), and they are few in number." Then he 
     ordered me to stay at my place and went not far away. I heard a voice 
     and intended to go to him but I remembered his order, "Stay at your 
     place till I return." On his return I said, "O Allah's Apostle! (What 
     was) that noise which I heard?" He said, "Did you hear anything?" I 
     said, "Yes." He said, "Gabriel came and said to me, 'Whoever amongst 
     your followers dies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter 
     Paradise.' " I said, "Even if he did such-and-such things (i.e. even

     creditors and wait till I come to you." I did so and the Prophet came

     When we approached Medina, I took the permission from the Prophet to

     Prophet asked, "Have you married a virgin or a matron (a widow or 
     divorcee)?" I said, "I have married a matron, as 'Abdullah (my father)
     died and left behind daughters small in their ages, so I married a

     Narrated Aisha:
<p>

     Abu bin Zam'a and Sad bin Abi Waqqas carried the case of their claim 
     of the (ownership) of the son of a slave-qirl of Zam'a before the 
     Prophet. Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! My brother, before his death, 
     told me that when I would return (to Mecca), I should search for the 
     son of the slave-girl of Zam'a and take him into my custody as he was 
     his son." 'Abu bin Zam'a said, 'the is my brother and the son of the 
     slave-girl of my father, and was born or my father's bed." The Prophet
     noticed a resemblance between Utba and the boy but he said, "O 'Abu 
     bin Zam'a! You will get this boy, as the son goes to the owner of the 
     bed. You, Sauda, screen yourself from the boy."

     Narrated 'Abdullah bin Ka'b bin Malik Al-Ansari from Ka'b bin Malik:
<p>

     That 'Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad Al-Aslami owed him some debt. Ka'b met 
     him and caught hold of him and they started talking and their voices 
     grew loudest. The Prophet passed by them and addressed Ka'b, pointing 
     out to him to reduce the debt to one half. So, Ka'b got one half of 
     the debt and exempted the debtor from the other half.

     Narrated Khabbab:
<p>

     I was a blacksmith In the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, and 'Asi 
     bin Wail owed me some money. I went to him to demand it, but he said 
     to me, "I will not pay you unless you reject faith in Muhammad." I 
     replied, "By Allah, I will never disbelieve Muhammad till Allah let 
     you die and then resurrect you." He said, "Then wait till I die and 
     come to life again, for then I will be given property and offspring 
     and will pay your right." So, thus revelation came: "Have you seen him
     who disbelieved in Our signs and yet says, 'I will be given property 
     and offspring?' "  (19.77)
