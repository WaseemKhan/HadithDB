     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     The Prophet said, "Allah created Adam in his complete shape and form (directly), sixty cubits 
     (about 30 meters) in height. When He created him, He said (to him), 
     "Go and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what they
     will say in reply to you, for that will be your greeting and the 
     greeting of your offspring." Adam (went and) said, 'As-Salamu alaikum 
     (Peace be upon you).' They replied, 'AsSalamu-'Alaika wa Rahmatullah 
     (Peace and Allah's Mercy be on you) So they increased 'Wa Rahmatullah'
     The Prophet added 'So whoever will enter Paradise, will be of the 
     shape and form of Adam. Since then the creation of Adam's
     (offspring) (i.e. stature of human beings is being diminished 
     continuously) to the present time."

     Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:
<p>

     Al-Fadl bin 'Abbas rode behind the Prophet as his companion rider on 
     the back portion of his she camel on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering of 
     sacrifice, 10th Dhul-Hijja) and Al-Fadl was a handsome man. The 
     Prophet stopped to give the people verdicts. In the meantime, a 
     beautiful woman From the tribe of Khath'am came, asking the verdict of
     Allah's Apostle. Al-Fadl started looking at her as her beauty 
     attracted him. The Prophet looked behind while Al-Fadl was looking at 
     her; so the Prophet held out his hand backwards and caught the chin of
     Al-Fadl and turned his face (to the owner sides in order that he 
     should not gaze at her. She said, "O Allah's Apostle! The obligation 
     of Performing Hajj enjoined by Allah on His worshipers, has become due
     (compulsory) on my father who is an old man and who cannot sit firmly 
     on the riding animal. Will it be sufficient that I perform Hajj on his
     behalf?" He said, "Yes."

     As-Salam be on so-and-so. When the Prophet finished his prayer, he 
     faced us and said, "Allah Himself is As-Salam (Peace), so when one

     Sa'd bin Ubada (who was sick) at the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith

     The Prophet passed by a gathering in which there were Muslims and 
     pagan idolators and Jews, and among them there was 'Abdullah bin Ubai 
     bin Salul, and there was 'Abdullah bin Rawaha too. When a cloud of 
     dust raised by the animal covered that gathering, 'Abdullah bin Ubai 
     covered his nose with his Rida (sheet) and said (to the Prophet), 
     "Don't cover us with dust." The Prophet greeted them and then stopped,
     dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also
     recited to them the Holy Quran. 'Abdullah bin Ubai' bin Salul said, "O
     man! There is nothing better than what you say, if what you say is the
     truth. So do not trouble us in our gatherings. Go back to your mount 
     (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your tales) to 
     him." On that 'Abdullah bin Rawaha said, "(O Allah's Apostle!) Come to
     us and bring it(what you want to say) in our gatherings, for we love 
     that." So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started quarreling till
     they were about to fight and clash with one another. The Prophet kept 
     on quietening them (till they all became quiet). He then rode his 
     animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa'd bin 'Ubada, he said, 
     "O Sa'd, didn't you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant 'Abdullah bin
     Ubai). He said so-and-so." Sa'd bin 'Ubada said, "O Allah's Apostle! 
     Excuse and forgive him, for by Allah, Allah has given you what He has 
     given you. The people of this town decided to crown him (as their 
     chief) and make him their king. But when Allah prevented that with the
     Truth which He had given you, it choked him, and that was what made 
     him behave in the way you saw him behaving." So the Prophet excused

     Narrated 'Ali:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair bin Al-Awwam and Abu Marthad 
     Al-Ghanawi, and all of us were horsemen, and he said, "Proceed till 
     you reach Rawdat Khakh, where there is a woman from the pagans 
     carrying a letter sent by Hatib bin Abi Balta'a to the pagans (of 
     Mecca)." So we overtook her while she was proceeding on her camel at 
     the same place as Allah's Apostle told us. We said (to her) "Where is 
     the letter which is with you?" She said, "I have no letter with me." 
     So we made her camel kneel down and searched her mount (baggage etc) 
     but could not find anything. My two companions said, "We do not see 
     any letter." I said, "I know that Allah's Apostle did not tell a lie. 
     By Allah, if you (the lady) do not bring out the letter, I will strip 
     you of your clothes' When she noticed that I was serious, she put her 
     hand into the knot of her waist sheet, for she was tying a sheet round
     herself, and brought out the letter. So we proceeded to Allah's 
     Apostle with the letter. The Prophet said (to Habib), "What made you o
     what you have done, O Hatib?" Hatib replied, "I have done nothing 
     except that I believe in Allah and His Apostle, and I have not changed
     or altered (my religion). But I wanted to do the favor to the people 
     (pagans of Mecca) through which Allah might protect my family and my 
     property, as there is none among your companions but has someone in 
     Mecca through whom Allah protects his property (against harm). The 
     Prophet said, "Habib has told you the truth, so do not say to him 
     (anything) but good." 'Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "Verily he has 
     betrayed Allah, His Apostle, and the believers! Allow me to chop his 
     neck off!" The Prophet said, "O 'Umar! What do you know; perhaps Allah
     looked upon the Badr warriors and said,  'Do whatever you like, for I 
     have ordained that you will be in Paradise.'" On that 'Umar wept and 
     said, "Allah and His Apostle know best."

     Narrated 'Abdullah:
<p>

     One day the Prophet divided and distributed something amongst the 
     people whereupon an Ansari man said, "In this division Allah's 
     Countenance has not been sought." I said, "By Allah! I will go (and 
     inform) the Prophet." So I went to him while he was with a group of 
     people, and I secretly informed him of that, whereupon he became so 
     angry that his face became red, and he then said, "May Allah bestow 
     His Mercy on Moses (for) he was hurt more than that, yet he remained 
     patient."

     offered the prayer with them.
