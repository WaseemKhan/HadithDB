<p>

     'Aisha  said, "We set out with the sole intention of performing Hajj 
     and when we reached Sarif, (a place six miles from Mecca) I got my 
     menses. Allah's Apostle came to me while I was weeping. He said 'What 
     is the matter with you? Have you got your menses?' I replied, 'Yes.' 
     He said, 'This is a thing which Allah has ordained for the daughters 
     of Adam. So do what all the pilgrims do with the exception of the 
     Taw-af (Circumambulation) round the Ka'ba." 'Aisha added, "Allah's 
     Apostle sacrificed cows on behalf of his wives."

     your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence 
     and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by

     in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of 
     two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the 
     affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. 
     Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her 
     menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the 
     deficiency in her religion."

     (the wife of the Prophet) During my menses, I never prayed, but used 
     to sit on the mat beside the mosque of Allah's Apostle. He used to 
     offer the prayer on his sheet and in prostration some of his clothes 
     used to touch me."
