     Narrated Ka'b bin 'Ujra:
<p>

     I came to the Prophet and he said to me, "Come near." So I went near 
     to him and he said, "Are your lice troubling you?" I replied, "Yes." 
     He said, "(Shave your head and) make expiation in the form of fasting,
     Sadaqa (giving in charity), or offering a sacrifice." (The 
     sub-narrator) Aiyub said, "Fasting should be for three days, and the 
     Nusuk (sacrifice) is to be a sheep, and the Sadaqa is to be given to 
     six poor persons."

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     A man came to the Prophet and said, "I am ruined!" The Prophet said, 
     "What is the matter with you?" He said, "I had sexual relation with my
     wife (while I was fasting) in Ramadan." The Prophet said, "Have you 
     got enough to manumit a slave?" He said, "No." The Prophet said, "Can 
     you fast for two successive months?" The man said, "No." The Prophet 
     said, "Can you feed sixty poor persons?" The man said, "No." Then the 
     Prophet said to him, "Sit down," and he sat down. Afterwards an 'Irq, 
     i.e., a big basket containing dates was brought to the Prophet and the
     Prophet said to him, "Take this and give it in charity." The man said,
     "To poorer people than we?" On that, the Prophet smiled till his 
     premolar teeth became visible, and then told him, "Feed your family 
     with it." (See Hadith No. 157, Vol 3)

     Narrated Nafi:
<p>

     Ibn Umar used to give the Zakat of Ramadan (Zakat-al-Fitr) according 
     to the Mudd of the Prophet, the first Mudd, and he also used to give 
     things for expiation for oaths according to the Mudd of the Prophet. 
     Abu Qutaiba said, "Malik said to us, 'Our Mudd (i.e., of Medina) is 
     better than yours and we do not see any superiority except in the Mudd
     of the Prophet!' Malik further said, to me, 'If a ruler came to you 
     and fixed a Mudd smaller than the one of the Prophet, by what Mudd 
     would you measure what you give (for expiation or Zakat-al-Fitr?' I 
     replied, 'We would give it according to the Mudd of the Prophet' On 
     that, Malik said, 'Then, don't you see that we have to revert to the 
     Mudd of the Prophet ultimately?'"

     I went to Allah's Apostle along with a group of people from (the tribe

     not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mount you on." We
     stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were
     brought to the Prophet and he ordered that we be given three camels. 
     When we set out, some of us said to others, "Allah will not bless us, 
     as we all went to Allah's Apostle asking him for mounts, and although 
     he had sworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us." So we 
     returned to the Prophet; and mentioned that to him. He said, "I have 
     not provided you with mounts, but Allah has. By Allah, Allah willing, 
     if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the 
     first, I make expiration for my (dissolved) oath, and do what is 
     better and make expiration."

     Narrated Zahdam al-Jarmi:
<p>

     We were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash'sari, and as there were ties of 
     friendship and mutual favors between us and his tribe. His meal was 
     presented before him and there was chicken meat in it. Among those who
     were present there was a man from Bani Taimillah having a red 
     complexion as a non-Arab freed slave, and that man did not approach 
     the meal. Abu Musa said to him, "Come along! I have seen Allah's 
     Apostle eating of that (i.e., chicken)." The man said, "I have seen it
     (chickens) eating something I regarded as dirty, and so I have taken 
     an oath that I shall not eat (its meat) chicken." Abu Musa said, "Come
     along! I will inform you about it (i.e., your oath). 
<p>

     Once we went to Allah's Apostle in company with a group of 
     Ash'airiyin, asking him for mounts while he was distributing some 
     camels from the camels of Zakat. (Aiyub said, "I think he said that 
     the Prophet was in an angry mood at the time.") The Prophet said, 'By 
     Allah! I will not give you mounts, and I have nothing to mount you 
     on.' After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah's 
     Apostle and he said, "Where are those Ash'ariyin? Where are those 
     Ash'ariyin?" So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat 
     good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to
     my companions, 'We went to Allah's Apostle to give us mounts, but he 
     took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he 
     sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah's Apostle forgot his 
     oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken 
     advantage of the fact that Allah's Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath.
     So let us return to Allah's Apostle to remind him of his oath.' We 
     returned and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! We came to you and asked you 
     for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) 
     but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you
     have forgotten your oath.' The Prophet said, 'Depart, for Allah has 
     given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then 
     later find another thing better than that, I do what is better, and 
     make expiation for the oath.' "
