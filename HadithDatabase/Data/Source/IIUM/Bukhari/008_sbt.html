     Narrated Abu Dhar:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was 
     opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with 
     Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith 
     and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he 
     took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I 
     reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the 
     heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel 
     answered: 'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel 
     replied, 'Yes, Muhammad I is with me.' He asked, 'Has he been called?'
     Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the 
     nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his 
     right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he 
     laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, 
     'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is 
     he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and the people on his right and left are 
     the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of 
     Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he 
     looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left 
     he weeps.'
<p>

     Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he 
     (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper 
     said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said 
     and he opened the gate. Anas said: "Abu Dhar added that the Prophet 
     met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not 
     mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the 
     Prophet ) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth 
     heaven. Anas said, "When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by 
     Idris, the latter said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' 
     The Prophet asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Idris." The 
     Prophet added, "I passed by Moses and he said, 'Welcome! O pious 
     Prophet and pious brother.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' Gabriel 
     replied, 'He is Moses.' Then I passed by Jesus and he said, 'Welcome! 
     O pious brother and pious Prophet.' I asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel 
     replied, 'He is Jesus.
<p>

     Then I passed by Abraham and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and 
     pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is 
     Abraham. The Prophet added, 'Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place 
     where I heard the creaking of the pens." Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik 
     said: The Prophet said, "Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my 
     followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses 
     who asked me, 'What has Allah enjoined on your followers?' I replied, 
     'He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.' Moses said, 'Go back to your 
     Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to
     bear it.' (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He
     reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him 
     about it, he said, 'Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be
     able to bear it.' So I returned to Allah and requested for further 
     reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he 
     said to me: 'Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able 
     to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, 'These are five 
     prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does
     not change.' I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again.
     I replied, 'Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.' Then Gabriel took
     me till we '' reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost 
     boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was 
     admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of 
     pearls and its earth was of musk."

     The Prophet passed through the lane of Khaibar quickly and my knee was
     touching the thigh of the Prophet . He uncovered his thigh and I saw 
     the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, 
     he said, 'Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach near a
     (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning of those who
     have been warned.' He repeated this thrice. The people came out for 
     their jobs and some of them said, 'Muhammad (has come).' (Some of our 
     companions added, "With his army.") We conquered Khaibar, took the 
     captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, 'O Allah's
     Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.' The Prophet said, 
     'Go and take any slave girl.' He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to
     the Prophet and said, 'O Allah's Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai 
     to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraiza and 
     An-Nadir and she befits none but you.' So the Prophet said, 'Bring him
     along with her.' So Dihya came with her and when the Prophet saw her,

     captives.' Anas added: The Prophet then manumitted her and married 
     her."

     marriage (ceremony) and at night she sent her as a bride to the 
     Prophet . So the Prophet was a bridegroom and he said, 'Whoever has 
     anything (food) should bring it.' He spread out a leather sheet (for 
     the food) and some brought dates and others cooking butter. (I think

     he stayed in a Mashruba (attic room) having stairs made of date palm 
     trunks. So his companions came to visit him, and he led them in prayer
     sitting, whereas his companions were standing. When he finished the 
     prayer, he said, "Imam is meant to be followed, so when he says 
     'Allahu Akbar,' say 'Allahu Akbar' and when he bows, bow and when he 
     prostrates, prostrate and if he prays standing pray, standing. After 
     the 29th day the Prophet came down (from the attic room) and the 
     people asked him, "O Allah's Apostle! You swore that you will not go 
     to your wives for one month." He said, "The month is 29 days."

<p>

     who was one of the companions of Allah's Apostle and one of the 
     Ansar's who took part in the battle of Badr: I came to Allah's Apostle
     and said, "O Allah's Apostle I have weak eyesight and I lead my people
     in prayers. When it rains the water flows in the valley between me and
     my people so I cannot go to their mosque to lead them in prayer. O 
     Allah's Apostle! I wish you would come to my house and pray in it so 
     that I could take that place as a Musalla. Allah's Apostle said. 
     "Allah willing, I will do so." Next day after the sun rose high, 
     Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr came and Allah's Apostle asked for 
     permission to enter. I gave him permission and he did not sit on 
     entering the house but said to me, "Where do you like me to pray?" I 
     pointed to a place in my house. So Allah's Apostle stood there and 
     said, 'Allahu Akbar', and we all got up and aligned behind him and 
     offered a two-Rak'at prayer and ended it with Taslim. We requested him
     to stay for a meal called "Khazira" which we had prepared for him. 
     Many members of our family gathered in the house and one of them said,
     "Where is Malik bin Al-Dukhaishin or Ibn Al-Dukhshun?" One of them 
     replied, "He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle." 
     Hearing that, Allah's Apostle said, "Do not say so. Haven't you seen 
     that he said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah' for 
     Allah's sake only?" He said, "Allah and His Apostle know better. We 
     have seen him helping and advising hypocrites."

     fourteen nights. Then he sent for Bani An-Najjar and they came armed

     sitting over his Rahila (Mount) with Abu Bakr riding behind him and 
     all Banu An-Najjar around him till he dismounted at the courtyard of 
     Abu Aiyub's house. The Prophet loved to pray wherever the time for the
     prayer was due even at sheep-folds. Later on he ordered that a mosque 
     should be built and sent for some people of Banu-An-Najjar and said, 
     "O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of 
     land of yours." They replied, "No! By Allah! We do not demand its 
     price except from Allah." Anas added: There were graves of pagans in 
     it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees in
     it. The Prophet ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and 
     the unleveled land be level led and the date-palm trees be cut down . 
     (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees towards
     the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone 
     side-walls (of the mosque). His companions brought the stones while

     So please forgive the Ansars and the emigrants. "

     came to me and wanted to interrupt my prayers (or said something 
     similar) but Allah enabled me to overpower him. I wanted to fasten him
     to one of the pillars of the mosque so that all of you could See him 
     in the morning but I remembered the statement of my brother Solomon 
     (as stated in Quran): My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a kingdom 
     such as shall not belong to anybody after me (38.35)." The sub 
     narrator Rauh said, "He (the demon) was dismissed humiliated."

     added, "He prayed two Rakat and then finished the prayer with Tasllm.

     hesitated to ask the Prophet. A long-handed man called Dhul-Yadain

     Prophet stood up again and led the prayer, completing the remaining 
     prayer, forgotten by him, and performed Talsrm, and then said, 'Allahu
     Akbar.' And then he did a prostration as he used to prostrate or 
     longer than that. He then raised his head saying, 'Allahu Akbar; he

     prostrate or longer than that. Then he raised his head and said,
