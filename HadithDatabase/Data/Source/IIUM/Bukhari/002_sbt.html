     When the Prophet came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers

     Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he 
     wished that he could pray facing the Ka'ba (at Mecca). The first 
     prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the

     bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing 
     them, "By Allah, I testify that I have prayed with Allah's Apostle 
     facing Mecca (Ka'ba).' Hearing that, those people changed their 
     direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the

     prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during 
     the prayers, they disapproved of it.

     Al-Bara' added, "Before we changed our direction towards the Ka'ba 
     (Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we 
     did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers.) Allah 
     then revealed: And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be

     Once a Jew said to me, "O the chief of believers! There is a verse in 
     your Holy Book Which is read by all of you (Muslims), and had it been 
     revealed to us, we would have taken that day (on which it was revealed
     as a day of celebration." 'Umar bin Al-Khattab asked, "Which is that 
     verse?" The Jew replied, "This day I have perfected your religion For 
     you, completed My favor upon you, And have chosen for you Islam as 
     your religion." (5:3) 'Umar replied,"No doubt, we know when and where 
     this verse was revealed to the Prophet. It was Friday and the Prophet 
     was standing at 'Arafat (i.e. the Day of Hajj)"

     Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaidullah:
<p>

     A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and we heard
     his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he 
     came near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam. 
     Allah's Apostle said, "You have to offer prayers perfectly five times 
     in a day and night (24 hours)." The man asked, "Is there any more 
     (praying)?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, but if you want to offer the
     Nawafil prayers (you can)." Allah's Apostle further said to him: "You 
     have to observe fasts during the month of Ramad, an." The man asked, 
     "Is there any more fasting?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, but if you 
     want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)" Then Allah's Apostle 
     further said to him, "You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)."
     The man asked, "Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to 
     pay?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, unless you want to give alms of 
     your own." And then that man retreated saying, "By Allah! I will 
     neither do less nor more than this." Allah's Apostle said, "If what he
     said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted 
     Paradise)."

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people, 
     (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, "What is faith?" Allah's Apostle 
     replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with
     Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection." Then he further 
     asked, "What is Islam?" Allah's Apostle replied, "To worship Allah 
     Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory 
     charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan."  
     Then he further asked, "What is Ihsan (perfection)?" Allah's Apostle 
     replied, "To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot 
     achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is 
     looking at you." Then he further asked, "When will the Hour be 
     established?" Allah's Apostle replied, "The answerer has no better 
     knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its 
     portents.
<p>

     1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.
<p>

     2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing 
     with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is 
     one of five things which nobody knows except Allah.
<p>

     The Prophet then recited: "Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge
     of the Hour--." (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet 
     asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. 
     Then the Prophet said, "That was Gabriel who came to teach the people 
     their religion." Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all 
     that as a part of faith.

     I used to sit with Ibn 'Abbas and he made me sit on his sitting place.
     He requested me to stay with him in order that he might give me a 
     share from his property. So I stayed with him for two months. Once he 
     told (me) that when the delegation of the tribe of 'Abdul Qais came to
     the Prophet, the Prophet asked them, "Who are the people (i.e. you)? 
     (Or) who are the delegate?" They replied, "We are from the tribe of 
     Rabi'a." Then the Prophet said to them, "Welcome! O people (or O 
     delegation of 'Abdul Qais)! Neither will you have disgrace nor will 
     you regret." They said, "O Allah's Apostle! We cannot come to you 
     except in the sacred month and there is the infidel tribe of Mudar 
     intervening between you and us. So please order us to do something 
     good (religious deeds) so that we may inform our people whom we have 
     left behind (at home), and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on 
     them)." Then they asked about drinks (what is legal and what is 
     illegal). The Prophet ordered them to do four things and forbade them 
     from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone and asked 
     them, "Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?" They 
     replied, "Allah and His Apostle know better." Thereupon the Prophet 
     said, "It means:
<p>

     1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and 
     Muhammad is Allah's Apostle. 
<p>

     2. To offer prayers perfectly

     Then he forbade them four things, namely, Hantam, Dubba,' Naqir Ann 
     Muzaffat or Muqaiyar; (These were the names of pots in which Alcoholic
     drinks were prepared) (The Prophet mentioned the container of wine and
     he meant the wine itself). The Prophet further said (to them):

     you have left behind."
