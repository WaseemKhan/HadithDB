     Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:
<p>

     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "The reward of deeds depends upon the 
     intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he 
     has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman
     to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for."

     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     (the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked 
     Allah's Apostle "O Allah's Apostle! How is the Divine Inspiration 
     revealed to you?" Allah's Apostle replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed)
     like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of
     all and then this state passes ' off after I have grasped what is 
     inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to 
     me and I grasp whatever he says." 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the 
     Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the 
     Sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).

<blockquote>
<p>

     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     (the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine 
     Inspiration to Allah's Apostle was in the form of good dreams which 
     came true like bright day light, and then the love of seclusion was 
     bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira 
     where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days 
     before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the 
     journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to 
     take his food like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon 
     him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked 
     him to read. The Prophet replied, "I do not know how to read.
<p>

     The Prophet added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so
     hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again 
     asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon
     he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear 
     it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again 
     I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' 
     Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then 
     released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created 
     (all that exists) has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is 
     the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Apostle returned 
     with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went
     to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered
     him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that 
     had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." 
     Khadija replied, "Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You 
     keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the poor and the 
     destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving 
     calamity-afflicted ones."
<p>

     Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad 
     bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the PreIslamic Period became a Christian
     and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from
     the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an 
     old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to 
     the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! 
     What have you seen?" Allah's Apostle described whatever he had seen. 
     Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel 
     Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could 
     live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's 
     Apostle asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the 
     affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to
     what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should 
     remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would 
     support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine
     Inspiration was also paused for a while.
<p>

     Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari while talking about the period 
     of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet "While I 
     was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up
     and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira' sitting
     on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came
     back home and said, 'Wrap me (in blankets).' And then Allah revealed 
     the following Holy Verses (of Quran):
<p>

     'O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in garments!' Arise and warn (the 
     people against Allah's Punishment),... up to 'and desert the idols.' 
     (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently
     and regularly."

     Narrated Said bin Jubair:
<p>

     Ibn 'Abbas in the explanation of the Statement of Allah. 'Move not 
     your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith." (75.16) 
     Said "Allah's Apostle used to bear the revelation with great trouble 
     and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration." Ibn 'Abbas 
     moved his lips saying, "I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah's
     Apostle used to move his." Said moved his lips saying: "I am moving my
     lips, as I saw Ibn 'Abbas moving his." Ibn 'Abbas added, "So Allah 
     revealed 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste 
     therewith. It is for us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the
     ability to recite it (the Qur'an) (75.16-17) which means that Allah 
     will make him (the Prophet ) remember the portion of the Qur'an which 
     was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The Statement of 
     Allah: And 'When we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through 
     Gabriel) then you follow its (Qur'an) recital' (75.18) means 'listen 
     to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Allah) to make It clear to 
     you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and 
     its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, 
     Allah's Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after 
     his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it."

     Allah's Apostle was the most generous of all the people, and he used 
     to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel 
     met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him 
     the Qur'an. Allah's Apostle was the most generous person, even more 
     generous than the strong uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste

<blockquote>
<p>

     Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:
<p>

     Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to
     him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were 
     merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and 
     Jordan), at the time when Allah's Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan 
     and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to 
     Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and 
     he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his 
     translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, "Who 
     amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a 
     Prophet?" Abu Sufyan replied, "I am the nearest relative to him 
     (amongst the group)."
<p>

     Heraclius said, "Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his 
     companions stand behind him." Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his 
     translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions 
     to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they 
     (my companions) should contradict me." Abu Sufyan added, "By Allah! 
     Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not
     have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked 
     me about him was:
<p>

     'What is his family status amongst you?' 
<p>

     I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.' 
<p>

     Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the 
     same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No.'
<p>

     He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No.'
<p>

     Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'
<p>

     I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'
<p>

     He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'
<p>

     I replied, 'They are increasing.'
<p>

     He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion 
     become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No.'
<p>

     Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his 
     claim (to be a Prophet)?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No. '
<p>

     Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'
<p>

     I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he 
     will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against 
     him except that.
<p>

     Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'
<p>

     I replied, 'Yes.'
<p>

     Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'
<p>

     I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'
<p>

     Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'
<p>

     I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to 
     worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our 
     ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be 
     chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'
<p>

     Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked 
     you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very 
     noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families 
     amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody 
     else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.
     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that 
     this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you 
     whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the 
     negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought 
     that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.
<p>

     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he 
     said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered 
     how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a 
     lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed 
     him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. 
     And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of 
     people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or 
     decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is
     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further 
     asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his 
     religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was
     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when 
     its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked 
     you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and 
     likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered 
     you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah 
     alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to 
     worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be 
     chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this 
     place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he 
     was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and 
     if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him 
     and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius 
     then asked for the letter addressed by Allah's Apostle
<p>

     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded 
     it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: 
     "In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) 
     from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the 
     ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. 
     Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will
     be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this 
     invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your 
     Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah's Statement:)
<p>

     'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that 
     we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship 
     with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.
     Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those 
     who have surrendered to Allah).' (3:64).
<p>

     Abu Sufyan then added, "When Heraclius had finished his speech and had
     read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So 
     we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the 
     question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so 
     prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of
     him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the 
     conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided 
     me to it)."
<p>

     The sub narrator adds, "Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya' 
     (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn 
     An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya' 
     (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his 
     priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller 
     and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I
     saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared 
     (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The 
     people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you
     should not be afraid of them (Jews).
<p>

     'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'
<p>

     While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan
     to convey the news of Allah's Apostle to Heraclius was brought in. 
     Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see
     whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after 
     seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then 
     asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice
     circumcision.'
<p>

     (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs
     had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who 
     was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. 
     (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his 
     letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the 
     emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that 
     Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his 
     palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of 
     his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If 
     success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your 
     empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet 
     (i.e. embrace Islam).'
<p>

     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates 
     of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius 
     realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their
     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in 
     audience.
<p>

     (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the 
     strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated
     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of 
     Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).
