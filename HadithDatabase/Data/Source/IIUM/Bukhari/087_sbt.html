<p>

     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Apostle was in 
     the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a 
     dream but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in 
     seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Allah Alone) 
     continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take with him the 
     journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija 
     to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till 
     suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of 
     Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to read. The Prophet 
     replied, "I do not know how to read." (The Prophet added), "The angel 
     caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it
     anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I 
     replied, "I do not know how to read," whereupon he caught me again and
     pressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then 
     released me and asked me again to read, but again I replied, "I do not
     know how to read (or, what shall I read?)." Thereupon he caught me for
     the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, "Read: In
     the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created 
     man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most Generous...up to..... 
     ..that which he knew not." (96.15) 
<p>

     Then Allah's Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles 
     twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, "Cover 
     me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and then he 
     said, "O Khadija, what is wrong with me?" Then he told her everything 
     that had happened and said, 'I fear that something may happen to me." 
     Khadija said, 'Never! But have the glad tidings, for by Allah, Allah 
     will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and 
     kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your 
     guest generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones." 
     Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin 
     Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal 
     uncle, i.e., her father's brother, who during the Pre-Islamic Period 
     became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to 
     write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. 
     He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, "O 
     my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew." Waraqa asked, "O my 
     nephew! What have you seen?" The Prophet described whatever he had 
     seen. 
<p>

     Waraqa said, "This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who 
     keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young 
     and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." 
     Allah's Apostle asked, "Will they turn me out?" Waraqa replied in the 
     affirmative and said: "Never did a man come with something similar to 
     what you have brought but was treated with hostility. If I should 
     remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would 
     support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine
     Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad 
     as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from 
     the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a 
     mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before 
     him and say, "O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Apostle in truth" 
     whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and 
     would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the 
     inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he 
     used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him 
     and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn 'Abbas said regarding the
     meaning of: 'He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)' 
     (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of the sun during the day and 
     the light of the moon at night).

     direction in Paradise I waved it, it flew, carrying me there. I 
     narrated this (dream) to (my sister) Hafsa and she told it to the

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle said, "When the Day of Resurrection approaches, the 
     dreams of a believer will hardly fail to come true, and a dream of a 
     believer is one of forty-six parts of prophetism, and whatever belongs
     to prothetism can never be false." Muhammad bin Sirin said, "But I say
     this." He said, "It used to be said, 'There are three types of dreams:
     The reflection of one's thoughts and experiences one has during 
     wakefulness, what is suggested by Satan to frighten the dreamer, or 
     glad tidings from Allah. So, if someone has a dream which he dislikes,
     he should not tell it to others, but get up and offer a prayer." He 
     added, "He (Abu Huraira) hated to see a Ghul (i.e., iron collar around
     his neck in a dream) and people liked to see fetters (on their feet in
     a dream). The fetters on the feet symbolizes one's constant and firm 
     adherence to religion." And Abu 'Abdullah said, "Ghuls (iron collars) 
     are used only for necks."

     Allah's Apostle very often used to ask his companions, "Did anyone of

     Allah wished to tell. One morning the Prophet said, "Last night two

     The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By

     The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two

     other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned
     to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done
     before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! Who are these two 
     persons?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came across 
     something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually 
     clay-lined for baking bread)." I think the Prophet said, "In that oven
     t here was much noise and voices." The Prophet added, "We looked into 
     it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was 
     reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried
     loudly. I asked them, 'Who are these?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' And
     so we proceeded and came across a river." I think he said, ".... red 
     like blood." The Prophet added, "And behold, in the river there was a 
     man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many 
     stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. 
     The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone
     into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every
     time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, 'Who are
     these (two) persons?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we 
     proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most 
     repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was 
     a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my 
     companions, 'Who is this (man)?' They said to me, 'Proceed! Proceed!' 
     So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense 
     vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the 
     garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head 
     because of his great height, and around him there were children in 
     such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, 
     'Who is this?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till 
     we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever
     seen! My two companions said to me, 'Go up and I went up' The Prophet 
     added, "So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver
     bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the 
     gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men 
     with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you
     have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you 
     have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw 
     themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across 
     (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went 
     and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness 
     (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape." 
     The Prophet further added, "My two companions (angels) said to me, 
     'This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.' I raised up
     my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two 
     companions said to me, 'That (palace) is your place.' I said to them, 
     'May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.' They replied, 'As for 
     now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to
     them, 'I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which
     I have seen?' They replied, 'We will inform you: As for the first man 
     you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the 
     symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it 
     nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. 
     As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes 
     were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes
     out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads
     all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a 
     construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the 
     adulteresses;, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and 
     given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and the bad 
     looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it,
     is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the 
     garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who 
     die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith)." The narrator added: Some 
     Muslims asked the Prophet, "O Allah's Apostle! What about the children
     of pagans?" The Prophet replied, "And also the children of pagans." 
     The Prophet added, "My two companions added, 'The men you saw half 
     handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that 
     was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.'"
