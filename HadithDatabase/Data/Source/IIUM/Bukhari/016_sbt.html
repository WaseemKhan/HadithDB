     Narrated Ibn Umar:
<p>

     Once a person asked Allah's Apostle about the night prayer. Allah's 
     Apostle replied, "The night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by
     two Rakat and so on and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn 
     (Fajr prayer) he should pray one Raka and this will be a Witr for all 
     the Rakat which he has prayed before." Nafi' told that 'Abdullah bin 
     'Umar used to say Taslim between (the first) two Rakat and (the third)
     odd one in the Witr prayer, when he wanted to attend to a certain 
     matter (during that interval between the Rakat).

<p>

     Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:
<p>

     Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept 
     across the bed while Allah's Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. 
     The Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his 
     face and recited ten verses from Surat "Aal-Imran." Allah's Apostle 
     went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect
     way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside 
     him. The Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and 
     then prayed two Rakat five times and then ended his prayer with Witr. 
     He laid down till the Muadh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two
     Rakat (Sunna of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr 
     prayer.

     Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar :
<p>

     The Prophet said, "Night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by 
     two Rakat and so on, and if you want to finish it, pray only one Raka 
     which will be Witr for all the previous Rakat." Al-Qasim said, "Since 
     we attained the age of puberty we have seen some people offering a 
     three-Rakat prayer as Witr and all that is permissible. I hope there 
     will be no harm in it."

     Narrated 'Aisha:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle used to pray eleven Rakat at night and that was his 
     night prayer and each of his prostrations lasted for a period enough 
     for one of you to recite fifty verses before Allah's Apostle raised 
     his head. He also used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the 
     (compulsory) Fajr prayer and then lie down on his right side till the 
     Muadh-dhin came to him for the prayer.

     Narrated Anas bin Sirin:
<p>

     I asked Ibn 'Umar, "What is your opinion about the two Rakat before 
     the Fajr (compulsory) prayer, as to prolonging the recitation in 
     them?" He said, "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to pray at night two Rakat
     followed by two and so on, and end the prayer by one Raka Witr. He 
     used to offer two Rakat before the Fajr prayer immediately after the 
     Adhan." (Hammad, the sub-narrator said, "That meant (that he prayed) 
     quickly.)"

     I was going to Mecca in the company of 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and when I 
     apprehended the approaching dawn, I dismounted and offered the Witr 
     prayer and then joined him. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "Where have you 
     been?" I replied, "I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismounted 
     and prayed the Witr prayer." 'Abdullah said, "Isn't it sufficient for 
     you to follow the good example of Allah's Apostle?" I replied, "Yes, 
     by Allah." He said, "Allah's Apostle used to pray Witr on the back of 
     the camel (while on a journey)."

     Narrated 'Asim:
<p>

     I asked Anas bin Malik about the Qunut. Anas replied, "Definitely it 
     was (recited)". I asked, "Before bowing or after it?" Anas replied, 
     "Before bowing." I added, "So and so has told me that you had informed
     him that it had been after bowing." Anas said, "He told an untruth 
     (i.e. "was mistaken," according to the Hijazi dialect). Allah's 
     Apostle recited Qunut after bowing for a period of one month." Anas 
     added, "The Prophet sent about seventy men (who knew the Quran by 
     heart) towards the pagans (of Najd) who were less than they in number 
     and there was a peace treaty between them and Allah's Apostles (but 
     the Pagans broke the treaty and killed the seventy men). So Allah's 
     Apostle recited Qunut for a period of one month asking Allah to punish
     them."
