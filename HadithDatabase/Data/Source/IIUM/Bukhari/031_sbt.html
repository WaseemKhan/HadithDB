     Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaid-Ullah:
<p>

     A bedouin with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O 
     Allah's Apostle! Inform me what Allah has made compulsory for me as 
     regards the prayers." He replied: "You have to offer perfectly the 
     five compulsory prayers in a day and night (24 hours), unless you want
     to pray Nawafil." The bedouin further asked, "Inform me what Allah has
     made compulsory for me as regards fasting." He replied, "You have to 
     fast during the whole month of Ramadan, unless you want to fast more 
     as Nawafil." The bedouin further asked, "Tell me how much Zakat Allah 
     has enjoined on me." Thus, Allah's Apostle informed him about all the 
     rules (i.e. fundamentals) of Islam. The bedouin then said, "By Him Who
     has honored you, I will neither perform any Nawafil nor will I 
     decrease what Allah has enjoined on me. Allah's Apostle said, "If he 
     is saying the truth, he will succeed (or he will be granted 
     Paradise)."

     wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently, and if somebody 
     fights with him or abuses him, he should tell him twice, 'I am 
     fasting." The Prophet added, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, the 
     smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the 
     sight of Allah than the smell of musk. (Allah says about the fasting

     fear that it would be hard for my followers, I would have ordered them
     to clean their teeth with Siwak on every performance of ablution." The
