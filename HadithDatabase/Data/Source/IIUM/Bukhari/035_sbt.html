     Narrated Ibn Abbas:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle came to Medina and the people used to pay in advance 
     the price of fruits to be delivered within one or two years. (The 
     sub-narrator is in doubt whether it was one to two years or two to 
     three years.) The Prophet said, "Whoever pays money in advance for 
     dates (to be delivered later) should pay it for known specified weight
     and measure (of the dates)."

     the Prophet used to pay in advance for wheat (to be delivered later). 
     Abdullah replied, "We used to pay in advance to the peasants of Sham 
     for wheat, barley and olive oil of a known specified measure to be 
     delivered in a specified period." I asked (him), "Was the price paid 
     (in advance) to those who had the things to be delivered later?" 
     Abdullah bin Aufa replied, "We did not use to ask them about that." 
     Then they sent me to 'Abdur Rahman bin Abza and I asked him. He 
     replied, "The companions of the Prophet used to practice Salam in the 
     life-time of the Prophet; and we did not use to ask them whether they 
     had standing crops or not."

     them." Al-Miswar said, "By Allah, you shall buy them." Sad replied, 
     "By Allah, I will not pay more than four thousand (Dirhams) by 
     installments." Abu Rafi' said, "I have been offered five hundred 
     Dinars (for it) and had I not heard the Prophet saying, 'The neighbor 
     has more right than anyone else because of his nearness, I would not 
     give them to you for four-thousand (Dirhams) while I am offered 
     five-hundred Dinars (one Dinar equals ten Dirhams) for them." So, he
