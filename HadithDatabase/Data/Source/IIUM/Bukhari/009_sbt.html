     Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:
<p>

     Once I came riding a she-ass when I had just attained the age of 
     puberty. Allah's Apostle was offering the prayer at Mina with no wall 
     in front of him and I passed in front of some of the row. There I 
     dismounted and let my she-ass loose to graze and entered the row and 
     nobody objected to me about it.

     Whenever Allah's Apostle came out on 'Id day, he used to order that a 
     Harba (a short spear) to be planted in front of him (as a Sutra for 
     his prayer) and then he used to pray facing it with the people behind 
     him and used to do the same while on a journey. After the Prophet , 
     this practice was adopted by the Muslim rulers (who followed his 
     traditions).

     front of him, but Abu Said repulsed him with a push on his chest. 
     Finding no alternative he again tried to pass but Abu Said pushed him 
     with a greater force. The young man abused Abu Said and went to Marwan
     and lodged a complaint against Abu Said and Abu Said followed the 
     young man to Marwan who asked him, "O Abu Said! What has happened 
     between you and the son of your brother?" Abu Sa'id said to him, "I 
     heard the Prophet saying, 'If anybody amongst you is praying behind 
     something as a Sutra and somebody tries to pass in front of him, then 
     he should repulse him and if he refuses, he should use force against

     person who was praying. Abu Juhaim replied, "Allah's Apostle said, 'If
     the person who passes in front of another person in prayer knew the 
     magnitude of his sin he would prefer to wait for 40 (days, months or 
     years) rather than to pass in front of him." Abu An-Nadr said, "I do 
     not remember exactly whether he said 40 days, months or years."

     'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said, "While Allah's Apostle was praying beside 
     the Ka'ba, there were some Quraish people sitting in a gathering. One 
     of them said, 'Don't you see this (who does deeds just to show off)? 
     Who amongst you can go and bring the dung, blood and the abdominal 
     contents (intestines, etc). of the slaughtered camels of the family of
     so and so and then wait till he prostrates and put that in between his
     shoulders?' The most unfortunate amongst them ('Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait) 
     went (and brought them) and when Allah's Apostle prostrated, he put 
     them between his shoulders. The Prophet remained in prostration and 
     they laughed so much so that they fell on each other. A passerby went 
     to Fatima, who was a young girl in those days. She came running and 
     the Prophet was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed upon
     the Quraish on their faces. When Allah's Apostle completed his prayer,
     he said, 'O Allah! Take revenge on Quraish.' He said so thrice and 
     added, 'O Allah! take revenge on 'Amr bin Hisham, 'Utba bin Rabia, 
     Shaiba bin Rabi'a, Al-Walid bin'Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, 'Uqba bin Abi
     Mu'ait and 'Umar a bin Al-Walid." Abdullah added, "By Allah! I saw all
     of them dead in the battle field on the day of Badr and they were 
     dragged and thrown in the Qalib (a well) at Badr: Allah's Apostle then
     said, 'Allah's curse has descended upon the people of the Qalib 
     (well).
