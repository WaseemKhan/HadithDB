     Narrated Rafi' bin Khadij:
<p>

     We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We used to rent 
     the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given 
     to the landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected
     by blights etc., while the rest remained safe and vice versa, so the 
     Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold or silver were not 
     used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would 
     get so-and-so much. Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm if the land 
     belongs to one but both spend on it and the yield is divided between 
     them." Az-Zuhri had the same opinion. Al-Hasan said, "There is no harm
     if cotton is picked on the condition of having half the yield." 
     Ibrahim, Ibn Siain, 'Ata', Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said, "There 
     is no harm in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the
     basis that one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth
     is given to the weaver for his labor." Ma'am said, "There is no harm 
     in hiring animals for a definite (fixed) period on the basis that 
     one-third or one-fourth of the products carried by the animals is 
     given to the owner of the animals."

<p>

     The Prophet said, "While three men were walking, It started raining 
     and they took shelter (refuge) in a cave in a mountain. A big rock 
     rolled down from the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They 
     said to each other, "Think of good deeds which you did for Allah's 
     sake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that
     He may remove this rock from you." One of them said, 'O Allah! I had 
     old parents and small children and I used to graze the sheep for them.
     On my return to them in the evening, I used to milk (the sheep) and 
     start providing my parents first of all before my children. One day I 
     was delayed and came late at night and found my parents sleeping. I 
     milked (the sheep) as usual and stood by their heads. I hated to wake 
     them up and disliked to give milk to my children before them, although
     my children were weeping (because of hunger) at my feet till the day 
     dawned. O Allah! If I did this for Your sake only, kindly remove the 
     rock so that we could see the sky through it.' So, Allah removed the 
     rock a little and they saw the sky. The second man said, 'O Allah! I 
     was in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may have
     for a woman. I wanted to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I
     gave her one hundred Dinars. So, I struggled to collect that amount. 
     And when I sat between her legs, she said, 'O Allah's slave! Be afraid
     of Allah and do not deflower me except rightfully (by marriage).' So, 
     I got up. O Allah! If I did it for Your sake only, please remove the 
     rock.' The rock shifted a little more. Then the third man said, 'O 
     Allah! I employed a laborer for a Faraq of rice and when he finished 
     his job and demanded his right, I presented it to him, but he refused 
     to take it. So, I sowed the rice many time till I gathered cows and 
     their shepherd (from the yield). (Then after some time) He came and 
     said to me, 'Fear Allah (and give me my right)." I said, 'Go and take 
     those cows and the shepherd.' He said, 'Be afraid of Allah! Don't mock
     at me.' I said, 'I am not mocking at you. Take (all that).' So, he 
     took all that. O Allah! If I did that for Your sake only, please 
     remove the rest of the rock.' So, Allah removed the rock."
