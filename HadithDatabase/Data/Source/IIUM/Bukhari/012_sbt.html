     Narrated Anas bin Malik Al-Ansari:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle rode a horse and fell down and the right side of his 
     body was injured. On that day he prayed one of the prayers sitting and
     we also prayed behind him sitting. When the Prophet finished the 
     prayer with Taslim, he said, "The Imam is to be followed and if he 
     prays standing then pray standing, and bow when he bows, and raise 
     your heads when he raises his head; prostrate when he prostrates; and 
     if he says "Sami'a-l-lahu Liman hamida", you should say, "Rabbana 
     wa-laka-l hamd.:

<p>

     The People of Kufa complained against Sa'd to 'Umar and the latter 
     dismissed him and appointed 'Ammar as their chief . They lodged many 
     complaints against Sa'd and even they alleged that he did not pray 
     properly. 'Umar sent for him and said, "O Aba Ishaq! These people 
     claim that you do not pray properly." Abu Ishaq said, "By Allah, I 
     used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of Allah's Apostle and
     I never reduced anything of it. I used to prolong the first two Rakat 
     of 'Isha prayer and shorten the last two Rakat." 'Umar said, "O Aba 
     Ishaq, this was what I thought about you." And then he sent one or 
     more persons with him to Kufa so as to ask the people about him. So 
     they went there and did not leave any mosque without asking about him.
     All the people praised him till they came to the mosque of the tribe 
     of Bani 'Abs; one of the men called Usama bin Qatada with a surname of
     Aba Sa'da stood up and said, "As you have put us under an oath; I am 
     bound to tell you that Sa'd never went himself with the army and never
     distributed (the war booty) equally and never did justice in legal 
     verdicts." (On hearing it) Sa'd said, "I pray to Allah for three 
     things: O Allah! If this slave of yours is a liar and got up for 
     showing off, give him a long life, increase his poverty and put him to
     trials." (And so it happened). Later on when that person was asked how
     he was, he used to reply that he was an old man in trial as the result
     of Sa'd's curse. 'Abdul Malik, the sub narrator, said that he had seen
     him afterwards and his eyebrows were over-hanging his eyes owing to 
     old age and he used to tease and assault the small girls in the way.

<p>

     My father and I went to Abu Barza-al-Aslami to ask him about the 
     stated times for the prayers. He replied, "The Prophet used to offer 
     the Zuhr prayer when the sun just declined from its highest position 
     at noon; the 'Asr at a time when if a man went to the farthest place 
     in Medina (after praying) he would find the sun still hot (bright). 
     (The sub narrator said: I have forgotten what Abu Barza said about the
     Maghrib prayer). The Prophet never found any harm in delaying the 
     'Isha' prayer to the first third of the night and he never liked to 
     sleep before it and to talk after it. He used to offer the morning 
     prayer at a time when after finishing it one could recognize the 
     person sitting beside him and used to recite between 60 to 100 verses 
     in one or both the Rakat."

<p>

     The Prophet set out with the intention of going to Suq 'Ukaz (market 
     of 'Ukaz) along with some of his companions. At the same time, a 
     barrier was put between the devils and the news of heaven. Fire 
     commenced to be thrown at them. The Devils went to their people, who 
     asked them, "What is wrong with you?" They said, "A barrier has been 
     placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at 
     us." They said, "The thing which has put a barrier between you and the
     news of heaven must be something which has happened recently. Go 
     eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and 
     the news of heaven." Those who went towards Tuhama came across the 
     Prophet at a place called Nakhla and it was on the way to Suq 'Ukaz 
     and the Prophet was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When
     they heard the Qur'an they listened to it and said, "By Allah, this is
     the thing which has put a barrier between us and the news of heaven." 
     They went to their people and said, "O our people; verily we have 
     heard a wonderful recital (Qur'an) which shows the true path; we 
     believed in it and would not ascribe partners to our Lord." Allah 
     revealed the following verses to his Prophet (Sura 'Jinn') (72): "Say:
     It has been revealed to me." And what was revealed to him was the 
     conversation of the Jinns.

     them and as a result they will grow like the seeds growing on the bank
     of flowing water. Then when Allah had finished from the Judgments 
     amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise 
     and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise.
     He will be facing Hell, and will say, 'O Allah! Turn my face from the 
     fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.' Allah will 
     ask him, "Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted
     to you?' He will say, "No by Your (Honor) Power!" And he will give to 
     his Lord (Allah) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah 
     will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and 
     will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He 
     then will say, 'O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.' Allah 
     will ask him, 'Didn't you give pledges and make covenants (to the 
     effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you 
     requested at first?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most 
     wretched, amongst Your creatures.' Allah will say, 'If this request is
     granted, will you then ask for anything else?' He will say, 'No! By 
     Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.' Then he will give to 
     his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will 
     then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing 
     its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Allah 
     wills and then will say, 'O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.' Allah 
     will say, May Allah be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How 
     treacherous you are! Haven't you made covenants and given pledges that
     you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?' He 
     will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your 
     creatures.' So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and 
     will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all 
     his desires have been fulfilled . Then Allah will say, 'Request more 
     of such and such things.' Allah will remind him and when all his 
     desires and wishes; have been fulfilled, Allah will say "All this is 
     granted to you and a similar amount besides." Abu Said Al-Khudri, said
     to Abu Huraira, 'Allah's Apostle said, "Allah said, 'That is for you 
     and ten times more like it.' "Abu Huraira said, "I do not remember 
     from Allah's Apostle except (his saying), 'All this is granted to you 
     and a similar amount besides." Abu Sahd said, "I heard him saying, 
     'That is for you and ten times more the like of it."

     Narrated Abu Huraira:
<p>

     Some poor people came to the Prophet and said, "The wealthy people 
     will get higher grades and will have permanent enjoyment and they pray
     like us and fast as we do. They have more money by which they perform 
     the Hajj, and 'Umra; fight and struggle in Allah's Cause and give in 
     charity." The Prophet said, "Shall I not tell you a thing upon which 
     if you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? 
     Nobody would overtake you and you would be better than the people 
     amongst whom you live except those who would do the same. Say 
     "Sub-han-al-lah", "Alhamdu-lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" thirty three 
     times each after every (compulsory) prayer." We differed and some of 
     us said that we should say, "Subhan-al-lah" thirty three times and 
     "Alhamdu lillah" thirty three times and "Allahu Akbar" thirty four 
     times. I went to the Prophet who said, "Say, "Subhan-al-lah" and 
     "Alhamdu lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" all together for thirty three 
     times."

<p>

     (the clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba) Once Al-Mughira dictated to me in
     a letter addressed to Mu'awiya that the Prophet used to say after 
     every compulsory prayer, "La ilaha ilallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, 
     lahul-mulku wa-lahul-hamdu, wahuwa ala kulli shai in qadir. Allahumma 
     la mani 'a lima a'taita, wa la mu'tiya lima mana'ta, wa la yanfa'u

     Allah and He has no partner in Lordship or in worship or in the Names 
     and the Qualities, and for Him is the Kingdom and all the praises are 
     for Him and He is omnipotent. O Allah! Nobody can hold back what you 
     give and nobody can give what You hold back. Hard (efforts by anyone 
     for anything cannot benefit one against Your Will)." And Al-Hasan 
     said, "Al-jadd' means prosperity."
