<p>

     The Prophet said, "I will be at my Lake-Fount (Kauthar) waiting for 
     whoever will come to me. Then some people will be taken away from me 
     whereupon I will say, 'My followers!' It will be said, 'You do not 
     know they turned Apostates as renegades (deserted their religion).'" 
     (Ibn Abi Mulaika said, "Allah, we seek refuge with You from turning on
     our heels from the (Islamic) religion and from being put to trial").

     Narrated Hudhaifa:
<p>

     Allah's Apostle related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I
     have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other.
     The Prophet told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots 
     of men's hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur'an 
     and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet's traditions). 
     The Prophet further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He 
     said: "Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away 
     from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the 
     trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty 
     will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace
     of blister as when an ember is dropped on one's foot which would make 
     it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing 
     inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there
     be a trustworthy person. It will be said, 'in such-and-such tribe 
     there is an honest man,' and later it will be said about some man, 
     'What a wise, polite and strong man he is!' Though he will not have 
     faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart." No doubt, there came
     upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of
     you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what 
     is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would 
     compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except
     with such-and-such person.

     The people started asking the Prophet too many questions 
     importunately. So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, "You will 
     not ask me any question but I will explain it to you." I looked right 
     and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment
     and weeping. Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody,
     used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, "O 
     Allah's Apostle! Who is my father?" The Prophet replied, "Your father 
     is Hudhaifa." Then 'Umar got up and said, "We accept Allah as our 
     Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek 
     refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions." The Prophet said, " I
     have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise 
     and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that
     wall," Qatada said: This Hadith used to be mentioned as an explanation

<p>

     The Prophet went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business
     and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its
     gate and said to myself, "To day I will be the gatekeeper of the 
     Prophet though he has not ordered me." The Prophet went and finished 
     his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and 
     uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr
     came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), "Wait till I get 
     you permission." Abu Bakr waited outside and I went to the Prophet and
     said, "O Allah's Prophet! Abu Bakr asks your permission to enter." He 
     said, "Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise."
     So Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet and

     said (to him), "Wait till I get you permission." The Prophet said, 
     "Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise." So 
     Umar entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his
     legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became 
     fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then 
     'Uthman came and I said (to him), "Wait till I get permission for 
     you." The Prophet said, "Admit him and give him the glad tidings of 
     entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him." When he 
     entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to 
     the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and 
     hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so 
     I invoked Allah for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, "I interpreted

     thing by Allah"' (but it is only to test mankind whether they believe 
     in Allah or in Ad-Dajjal.)

     Allah's Apostle said. "While I was sleeping, I saw myself (in a dream)
     performing Tawaf around the Ka'ba. Behold, I saw a reddish-white man 
     with lank hair, and water was dropping from his head. I asked, "Who is
     this?' They replied, 'The son of Mary.' Then I turned my face to see 
     another man with a huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind 
     in one eye. His eye looked like a protruding out grape. They said (to 
     me), He is Ad-Dajjal." The Prophet added, "The man he resembled most 
     is Ibn Qatan, a man from the tribe of Khuza'a. "

     come, and he will be forbidden to enter the mountain passes of Medina.
     He will encamp in one of the salt areas neighboring Medina and there 
     will appear to him a man who will be the best or one of the best of 
     the people. He will say 'I testify that you are Ad-Dajjal whose story 
     Allah's Apostle has told us.' Ad-Dajjal will say (to his audience), 
     'Look, if I kill this man and then give him life, will you have any 
     doubt about my claim?' They will reply, 'No,' Then Ad-Dajjal will kill
     that man and then will make him alive. The man will say, 'By Allah, 
     now I recognize you more than ever!' Ad-Dajjal will then try to kill
